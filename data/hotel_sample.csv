Rancho Santa Fe,Rancho Valencia Resort Spa,Our experience at Rancho Valencia was absolutely perfect from beginning to end!!!! We felt special and very happy during our stayed. I would come back in a heart beat!!!
Rancho Santa Fe,Rancho Valencia Resort Spa,Amazing place. Everyone was extremely warm and welcoming. We've stayed at some top notch places and this is definitely in our top 2. Great for a romantic getaway or take the kids along as we did. Had a couple stuffed animals waiting for our girls upon arrival. Can't wait to go back.
Rancho Santa Fe,Rancho Valencia Resort Spa,"We booked a 3 night stay at Rancho Valencia to play some tennis, since it is one of the highest rated tennis resorts in America. This place is really over the top from a luxury standpoint and overall experience. The villas are really perfect, the staff is great, attention to details (includes fresh squeezed orange juice each morning), restaurants, bar and room service amazing, and the tennis program was really impressive as well. We will want to come back here again."
Hanover,Aloft Arundel Mills,Currently in bed writing this for the past hr 1/2 there have been dogs barking and squealing call the front desk to advise basically to be told there's nothing they can do. 315.00 and I can't sleep.

Hanover,Aloft Arundel Mills,"I stayed here with my family for my daughters wedding. It had a very accommodating staff, Olivia was excellent. The rooms were very well maintained. Would highly recommend this hotel, especially if your wedding venue is Celebrations at the Bay!"
Hanover,Aloft Arundel Mills,"Beautiful rooms and the nicest people working there. The front desk lady, Olivia, was extremely patient and helpful. We had lots of questions and she had just as many answers. The rooms were sleek and modern. The only thing that would make this hotel better would be free breakfast, but I really am asking for a lot. A++ stay. Thank... More"
Hanover,Aloft Arundel Mills,"We stayed here while visiting Maryland Live!. Cute hotel in a great location. Clean, with a very modern look, upgraded bathrooms and amenities and super nice staff. Would definitely recommend and stay there again!"
Hanover,Aloft Arundel Mills,"I travel a lot with my job, so I'm constantly staying at hotels. When my co-workers and I arrived late last night at the Aloft the people at the front desk were more than welcoming. When I wanted to order room service I was told it was too late however, Olivia at the front desk informed me of a Italian... More"
Vancouver,Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,"In my line of work, I use meeting space in hotels often. In my 15+ years of doing this work, this is the first time I've felt the undeniable pull to go out and write a hotel review, based solely on my meeting room experience. Though I did not use a guest room here, my colleagues who did shared that... More"
Vancouver,Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,"The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. Feels new, as if we were the first to stay there. Actually it is more opulent than I require. The free breakfast was good with sufficient choices including fresh fruit salad, eggs, bacon, bagels and pastries and more. It was a great location for our purpose:... More"
Vancouver,Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,"Very friendly staff, great free breakfast items each morning, room and facilities very clean, staff superb! We had a problem with the heating system in our room and they had someone fix it within minutes! Would highly recommend this location/hotel."
Vancouver,Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,"Upon arriving I see modern yet elegant decor which is pleasing to the eye. The front staff are very friendly. The room was clean including details, I'm talking no dust,no hair in bathroom-shower or beds which I tend to find in other hotels. Kudos to housekeeping. Sheets were crisp,beds were comfortable especially since this is a newer hotel. Breakfast in... More"
Vancouver,Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,This is a nice hotel with great staff. I have young children and the entire staff from the front desk staff to the breakfast staff were there to help us. This was our first visit to the Portland area and we plan to go back later this summer. We will stay at this hotel when we return.
Vancouver,Hampton Inn Suites PortlandVancouver,"Beautiful property and every staff member I encountered (front desk, housekeeping, breakfast hosts and GM) provided beyond excellent customer service! It's also conveniently located near restaurants, grocery stores starbucks and is a short drive to the freeways. I will definitely be back!"
Kansas City,Hotel Phillips,Old hotel with many remaining architectural charms and most modern amenities. The staff is exceptional: friendly and very accommodating. Has a little bit of the wear tear around the edges associated with an historic building but remarkably clean. Passed the allergy test.
Kansas City,Hotel Phillips,Very comfortable room. Our son came and they had a couch that they pulled out into a queen size bed. Free wifi and bottled water. This hotel was built back in the 20's and the decor is fabulous. A very neat hotel.
Kansas City,Hotel Phillips,Stayed here for second time recently. Gorgeous lobby. Friendly staff. Good free shuttle service. Our room this time was disappointing. King bed in too small space so that one side did not even have a lamp. Also the heating/cooling unit was right next to the bed and very noisy so we turned it off. Luckily it was not needed. Room... More
Kansas City,Hotel Phillips,"My husband and I always try to stay at the Hotel Phillips when we are in Kansas City. It is our favorite hotel and we have stayed at many. I feel at home there and the staff has always been exceptional, although we are not particularly demanding guests. Over the years we have probably spent at least 20 nights there.... More"
Kansas City,Hotel Phillips,"Just stayed one night but very happy. Nice, comfortable top floor room. Staff could not have been more helpful. Great location right by the Power Light district. Be prepared to pay for valet parking. Price of this was Offset though by free wine and cheese reception."
Huntingdon,The Inn at Solvang,"Everything was sold out in State College for Garth's concerts and the Inn came up as available...what an amazing find!! I'll be making the drive now each visit, just to stay there! The Inn is wonderfully decorated and I so enjoyed browsing all the books. Breakfast was amazing each morning. Thank you Stephanie and team!!"
Perry,Econolodge,I work here in Perry about 6 days out of the week. The People here are very friendly and willing to make your stay better. The hotel is great for my simple needs as I'm away from home. The rooms and hallways smell very clean each time I enter and leave. I will continue my business here for sure.
San Francisco,Hotel Zelos,"The hotel is just one of many that are on this new trend of firmer pillows and mattresses. This is the third hotel I have stayed in the last few months that have had firmer vs softer mattresses in their rooms. Aside from the bed The room was well appointed, comfortable and really The bonus Those super plushy and comfy robes in the closet. I miss a good hotel robe and this one had one!! Another little thing I loved was the spa water and coffee service in the lobby. High quality coffee and the New York Times Count me in! The maid service was friendly, attentive, and I even got a little note. Would totally stay again."
San Francisco,Hotel Zelos,"excellent location near convention center. friendly, willing staff. not a true luxury hotel in terms of the room I received, but a comfortable clean room, I didn't really need any more than that. After all you're here to visit San Francisco, not the hotel."
San Francisco,Hotel Zelos,"Hotel Zelos was a great place to stay in San Francisco. The staff is definitely the highlight of the hotel. The hotel itself is great: clean, well decorated, etc, but the people who work there were very helpful and friendly. The location is great being right next to the Powell BART station but the neighborhood is under construction. This obviously isn't the fault of the hotel and won't impact your stay. We couldn't hear any of the construction, but it makes it a little more difficult to get around. Overall, I definitely recommend Hotel Zelos!"
San Francisco,Hotel Zelos,"Pros: the location is awesome, the room size is great, the bathroom is nice also with a nice tub. Bad: the style and furniture starts to get really old, no breakfast despite the high price, the price is high, nothing exeptionnal... We were 4 people and so 4 reservations. Unfortunately one was missing. It was 1am so very bad surprise.... More"
Vineland,EconoLodge,After getting the bait and switch I decided I'd rather stay anywhere else. I'm sure I wasnt missing much as it looks like project style crack house apartments. The front desk (old middle eastern lady) was extremely rude and up charged me 50 when I got there! I travel and stay in hotels 250 days/ year and trust me this... More
Vineland,EconoLodge,"We had no choice but to stay here when a tornado hit the area and most of Vineland was without power. They charged us 190 for one night, wouldn't accept my AAA card and after leaving, we found out, we had been charged for 4 cats (which we don't own) and for another person. It was only my husband and... More"
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Hotel is in the perfect spot at the perfect price with the not so perfect view. Expedia rep said that it was facing the water and in a way it was but at a 45 degree angel past the parking lot and a few other obstructions. You have to stretch your neck at the furthest corner of the window to gain a peak. But it was still good though. The room sleeps like nobody's business. Once your head hits the pillows its light out. What I did not like was the front desk personnel. They really did not like there job and it showed. No eye contact, no smiles, no small talk, and what really disturbed me was at check in when I was told to sign this that's how it was put. I was like what is it Just sign - its nothing. Sir What am I signing. Oh if you have a party and smoke we can charge you 250.00(eyes still on monitor). Well sir. Tell me that. Next. Came back later that night to get snacks out of the cupboard. Over priced but I expected that but the person at the front desk was lifeless and didn't not even give me a total. She just says. Its charged to your room and kept staring at her monitor(again the monitor). WOW. But what makes up for some of the small inconsistencies is that fact that the water is in walking distance. The Ferris wheel is right there and Gaylord Hotel is right across the street. Good energy in the area and great spots to eat(Redstone) . Cant wait to visit again. Thanks for the snacks!"
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,Excellent experience. Will come again and book stay in the future
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"heat in room did not work properly, tv remote was broken excessive noise"
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Even though we were having problems, i.e. Feather allergy, Flat tire, key not working...the front desk personell were always gracious and helpful."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Brand new hotel in brand new retail area on the water. Easy to access off the beltway. Friendly staff, clean rooms, comfortable beds. Only complaint is that the full offering of the Hampton Inn breakfast was not available at the two times we came down (at 7am and 9am on a Saturday). The food at 9am had been in the bin too long. Still more choices than the continental breakfast at other places, including make-you-own waffles and yummy egg burritos. The fee for parking in the community garage was free with room key and even included a convenient room key drop upon final exit. Pool but no hot tub."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,It was a great stay
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"My sister came into town so we decided to go to The National Harbor for a night. Checking in, the hotel staff was very pleasant. Parking is in a garage behind the hotel, for 18. Our room was clean with nice views. The bed was very comfortable. We were able to walk comfortably to the harbor and sightsee. There are also restaurants and bars within walking distance. Breakfast was great, with canadian bacon and sausage patty meat options. There was also a waffle station, eggs, potatoes, fruit, yogurt, cereal, muffins, and other pastries. Checkout was a breeze, and the front desk staff again, was very pleasant. I very much enjoyed my stay and I will definitely return!"
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,Free breakfast! Attentive staff Fantastic location
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Excellent experience. Due to a mix-up on my part with the online travel service it was set up as a king rather than two queen beds, for two guys. I immediately called at the time and Hampton said they would make a note that a room with two queens was needed. When i got there, they didn't have a 2-queen room so they put me up in another king room (and my buddy stayed in the original room) at NO additional expense, and I moved to a 2-queen room the next day. That is awesome, customer-oriented service."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,The room was really big and clean. The staff was great. The hotel offers free breakfast that was really good ( not the usual crappy free breakfast) The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the air conditioner was regulated a motion sensor. We happened to be staying here on one of the hottest days of the year. The unit only stays on if the motion censor registers a person being in the room. Upon arriving the room was hot. It took about 20 mins for it to cool off. Also the AC cut off during the night when we fell asleep (No movement). I woke up in a pool of sweat and had to get up a walk around periodically to keep the AC going. That really sucked..
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,THE LOCATION OF THE HOTEL WAS OUTSTANDING. BUT THERE IS AND ADDITIONAL COST FOR PARKING JUST KEEP THAT IN MIND . IF YOU PAY FOR PARKING AT THE TIME YOU CHECK - IN BE SURE TO HAVE IT OUT BEFORE 1 PM THE NEXT DAY
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"was too quick, but very nice area"
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"clean, good area, very kind crew, easy to park"
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,We had a great overnight trip to the National Harbor near DC. All of the sites and entertainment were within walking distance!
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,I loved my stay VIP service all the way. I didn't want to leave. I can honestly say I will visit again. I give it 5 stars
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"The only problem I have was their sensorize INNCOM thermostat for air conditioning unit to start-up. If there are not movement inside the room, it will not kick in..... sucks!! the trick is, you have to keep moving while sleeping to keep the AC running (LOL)...."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Convenient and comfortable. Staff is great, breakfast and WiFi is a bonus."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,I was really disappointed with the TV service. Very few channels and poor quality.
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Awesome, Overall"
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,Better with more extras like breakfast. Preferred place to sleep for conference.
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,Very good experience. Staff was great. Enjoyed my times especially after my previous fiasco at that other hotel.
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"The hotel is located near all the attractions on the Harbor. We were provided more than we expected. There was parking right across the street restaurants within 5 minute walking distance and most of all hot and cold continental breakfast in the morning and hot coffee and tea available all day in the lobby. The rooms were very comfortable. I slept just like I was at home. Oh, I can't forget the staff: they were on their job with an attitude of excellence!"
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Repeat trip to this hotel for national conference attendance. Provides a quality stay, business center kept me in touch and great value for limited travel budget."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,I can't comment on the breakfast because we slept through it but everything else was excellent! I dont know why anyone would pay twice the price to stay at the Gaylord. 5 stars all the way!
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,Our room was a bit small. There was no microwave in the room. Location was more for couples than for family. The room itself And service were excellent.
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"This hotel is a peach. The staff are friendly, the hot breakfast filling and the rooms are immaculate. This should be a poster child for how to run a hotel."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Hampton Inn never disappoints. Always an affordable, clean hotel with attentive and friendly staff. The breakfast is always a plus too. Also, the National Harbor is a nice area full of shops and dining choices and seems to be a family friendly hangout destination for locals."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,I stayed here with some friends for a convention. It was a good room and the free breakfast was nice.
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"The hotel offers comfortable, somewhat elegant rooms but I suppose I was more impressed with the personnel and the warmth you get interacting with them. But for my phone call bills which seemed a bit high, my stay overall was great."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"We were there for 3 nights and used it as a staging area for sightseeing in DC and Baltimore. It's a nice, new hotel with reasonable rates. The staff was great with our kids, who had a blast at the pool and the 24/7 snack bar. The continental breakfast was great, but they should consider expanding their hours or at least allowing guests to finish the food that is out at 10, because every morning the food was taken away promptly at 10:00 even though the area was packed with guests still trying to get breakfast. Parking was 13/day and right across the street, which is quite reasonable for the DC area."
Oxon Hill,Hampton Inn Suites National HarborAlexandria Area,"Reasonable rates with free breakfast and right in front of Gaylord National Resort worked for me very well. The rooms have good size bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms was excellent. Parking is 11 per day and that is why I did not give it 5 stars. However, at National Harbor 11 is not bad especially when Gaylord charges double of it per day."
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"We hosted our annual Client Event at The Grand Del Mar and it was excellent!! The service, property, rooms, restaurants, and GOLF absolutely magnificent. Our conference managers were a gem, great service! Thank you for making an important event run so smoothly."
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"We enjoyed every minute of our stay in this breathtaking luxurious resort. The hotel is well kept and boasts caring and attending staff that do their best to make your stay memorable. The hotel offers great rooms, amenities and activities for all ages.

San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"We arrived here very tired after 24 hours of travel and airports and from the moment we arrived we felt like royalty. We dined a Amaya multiple times (please see separate review). The room was stunning and more than we could ever expect, nothing was to little for the staff and they all seemed genuinely friendly even down to the... More"
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"Stayed here for Thanksgiving and had the best experience. Before we arrived they asked my three year old little boy's name and when we arrived they had the most adorable kids travel pillow and personalized cookie waiting for him. They had children's games on the lawn right outside our bottom floor room, 105, and he had his face painted for... More"
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"This exquisite property located in the penasquitos canyon of North County is a spectacular retreat. In a setting resembling a Mediterranean villa, the hotel is truly grand, with spacious rooms, several dining options and cozy sitting areas to relax and soak up the well appointed spaces and beautifully manicured grounds. The resort amenities include golf, tennis, heated pools and a... More"
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"Five of the last six years, our company has hosted our annual meeting at the Grand Del Mar (and we regret not having it six out of six years). The GdM may be the top place to stay in the US, thus my recommendation is in the title of the review. The GdM is not inexpensive, but it is worth... More"
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,We drove down for a weekend getaway and to celebrate a special birthday. Our infant son accompanied us. The room was nice but the bathroom was fabulous. We appreciated the separate large shower from the tub and the private toilet. I wasn't as much of a fan of the closet being inside the bathroom as it was a trip to... More
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,This resort is GORGEOUS!! Check in was perfect our room wasnt ready (we were there early) so they took my phone number while we had drinks by the pool and in 20 mins or so our room was ready! The next day we had spa appts and the receptionist heard it was our honeymoon trip so after our massages we... More
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,The resort and staff are wonderful. The hotel is very nice and the groups are beautiful. The location is secluded so you need a rental car or to book the house car in advance. The concierge staff has not been to most of the spots so use trip advisor to help find the right places.
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"This is a very, very, very good hotel. My expectations were high because of the reviews I had read and it didn't quite meet my expectations. I know I'm knit-picking but while the abundance of fresh flower petals in my room were very nice I would gladly have traded them for a room service breakfast with hot coffee, hot ham... More"
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"Expensive Yes. Service Above the norm! Nickel and dime you on the small stuff Nope! (one of my pet peeves if you are going to stay at a hotel of this caliber) This property gives you 5 star service. Forgot your work out clothes Let the staff know your size. Need some feminine products, be there in 5 minutes. The... More"
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"If you don't mind staying out of town, the Fairmont Grand Del Mar is a top quality choice for San Diego located about 25 minutes north of the airport. It is a large traditional colonial property, with a beautiful golf course on the west side of the grounds, ample parking, equestrian facilities and a good spa (which has the best... More"
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"This property is absolutely pristine.

San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"I love The Grand Del Mar in Del Mar California. This might have been my 6th time there. It is the only hotel in the area that i will stay at. It is truly a 5 star property. The staff is professional and very attentive. The rooms are very spacious, with marble bathrooms and separate shower and soaking tub. The... More"
San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"We had a wonderful stay at the Fairmont! This is an excellent hotel, with great attention to detail including hotel grounds, architecture, amenities and staff. Service is first class and natural, you are made to feel very welcome. Great looking golf course, and plenty of other activities to enjoy such as walking, the pool, tennis. Or just relax in the...

San Diego,Fairmont Grand Del Mar,"To date, this takes the prize. It did not overwhelm me but I was, over the four days I stayed, consistently well served and impressed at the degree of detail that was maintained in every aspect of the experience. In the same way that the hotel service was a consistently delivered, high degree of service, without being over the top,... More"
Des Plaines,Best Western at OHare,It's a great place to stay and leave a car if you are flying out. The courtesy shuttle takes 10 minutes to get to O'Hare.
Des Plaines,Best Western at OHare,"Give Robert a raise! We were trying to catch a flight from O'Hare to ATL early in the morning and my girlfriend forgot her phone in the room. Luckily, we called and he managed to get the phone as we made our way back on the provided shuttle bus. Orlando the shuttle driver was quick to pull us into our... More"
Des Plaines,Best Western at OHare,Average hotel for decent price. It was balanced. Housekeeping did leave our door only ajar after cleaning one day. Arrrggghhhh!!!!! Nothing was missing.
Des Plaines,Best Western at OHare,The room key did not work i to go to lobby 4 times no parking under heavy construction noise the staff very incompetent I will not come back to this hotel
Kissimmee,Clarion Resort Waterpark,We Had the best time ever! r r What a ball we had at Clarion Resort Waterpark! r r The place was large enough to have plenty of rides but small enough to walk comfortably. r r The entire facility is NEW and all the rooms are well
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Awesome hotel. Virgin really took the time to figure out all things at are frustrating about staying in a hotel and fixed them - kudos!!! The hotel will become a regular haunt in the future. From free wifi, free cocktails, a mini bar you're not terrified to touch, not to mention the no check out time, they really are way ahead of the rest. Oh by the way did I mention the really cool room... Awesome! Highly recommend the hotel. From young teens to my parents in their 70's the hotel met our every need."
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Bad: The bed wasn't that comfy, which was surprising given all of the other amazing details. Sheets were rough/stiff- not cozy. Could be easily fixed, though!. Good: This was by far one of the best hotel experiences I've ever had. Check-in and check-out was super fast, staff was phenomenal, and the room was very intuitively set-up with thoughtful details technology. It was clear that Virgin isn't just a typical hotel. The chamber set-up of the room allowed for privacy comfort, even in a relatively small space. Snacks mini-bar had 7-11 prices. Everything was super clean, well serviced and wonderful. In short: STAY HERE!"
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Bad: Noisy in lower floors, but not at all at higher ones. Good: Very comfy beds, great lobby/bathroom"
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,Good: Staff went out of their way after checkout to locate an item I had left in the room. The room had already been cleaned and the staff got the item back to me as quickly as possible. Roof top bar was beautiful.
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Bad: A little bit of noise from the 'L' down below, but then again that is part of the character of the city. Good: Overall cleanliness, new feel, friendly efficient staff, great happy hour! Excellent location."
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,Bad: The room rate was terrible we had a Booking.com rate that was not honoured it soured the stay and was a big difference. We to date have no explanation!. Good: Location
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,Bad: Had a couple of glitches getting the room serviced but otherwise very friendly and helpful staff. Good: Great location. Nice rooms with exceptionally comfortable bed.
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,Good: A fun place to stay with great staff and lots going on in and around the hotel.
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,Would be nice if the duvet were in a duvet cover as I just get tangled between the flat sheets and the comforter Gym could really do with some more variety in terms of machinery - Its impossible to do much leg work as there is no squat rack with a bar - or even a smith machine which has multiple purposes Super helpful staff 24/7 - very accommodating of my unusual hours Room service menu is amazing Views are amazing Cerise Bar on the roof is epic and the bartenders are amazing I will be coming back and SOON!
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,Bad: The hotel is next to train tracks so there is some noise from that pretty often but it's really not so bad and you kind of have to expect some noise when you're staying at a hotel that's literally in the middle of the city. Good: Very tech friendly as the hotel has its own smartphone app which allows you to order room service and control the thermostat among other things. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The room is designed very well. Also the price of the mini bar items are actually reasonable.
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,Bad: Loved everything about Virgin Hotel. Good: First and foremost the staff - just wonderful. Friendly and very patient with all the enquiries we made! And we were there for the historic parade to celebrate the Chicago Cubs World Series win and the icing on the cake was another historic win - Ireland beating the All Blacks after 111 years!
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Bad: A little sticker shock with 65/night valet parking, but I hadn't done my research for cheaper options, so not a big deal. Good: Super hip and definitely a young techy vibe, but everyone was friendly and helpful. Room was as described and very spacious for the location and price. Even though it is right at the corner of the L Tracks, sound wasn't a problem. Exactly what was needed!"
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Bad: Everything was great. Good: Superior experience. Loved everything about this hotel. Very comfortable, well thought out and fun arrangement of the room, great shower and products, good restaurants, wonderful roof bar. Looking forward to the next visit!"
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Bad: We were on the 9th floor and slept really well but could hear the metro. Earplugs are supplied which were useful to my husband. There were two tvs in our one bedroom suite but only one remote control - odd when we wanted to watch two different shows. Good: Absolutely perfect location in Chicago, within one block of the metro, walking distance to most of the top areas to visit and very good restaurants. Very comfortable room and bed, neat layout for the closet and vanity, wonderful shower, cool design features (Vespa chair, red fridge, furniture)."
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Bad: Intermittent barking dog!. Good: Spacious suite, recommend end room on high floor"
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Good: The suite was very well apointed, plenty of room for an inroom breakfast --the bed and bedding were very nice. The staff couldnt be nicer We had a great night on the rooftop deck.... we never left the propertysmall plates a DJ and wonderful views. Ill be back"
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Bad: A very minor quibble: only one side of the bed had a nightstand. Good: Room design was well thought out and executed, making an average-sized space especially user-friendly for a couple. Also, the room had more power outlets than I've ever seen in a hotel room. Staff was helpful and friendly, second-floor bar was very nice."
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,Bad: The view. Good: Everything
Chicago,Virgin Hotels Chicago,"Beds were very comfortable, room amenities perfect. Enjoyed the lobby level coffee shop, roof top bar and happy hour on the 2nd level every evening. A great bonus!"
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: Timing seemed to be off. Had to wait a very long time for breakfast, longer than people who had come in after us. Had to wait a very long time for the valet to bring our car, seemed to be some kind of communication issue. They were nice about it, and so were we, but it seemed to be a theme, which was a bit of a disappointment. Good: Nicely appointed room, great location."
Boston,The Boxer,"Good: I loved the quirkiness and style of the hotel. The staff were so friendly and accommodating. The drinks at the bar were top notch and the price for the location was unbeatable. And the bed, the bed was perfect. I slept like a baby."
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: I was supposed to get a room with two beds and ended up with a room with one full bed for me and my husband.it was very small!.
Boston,The Boxer,Staff weren't helpful and no one tried to come and clean our room on several nights. Rooms were very small. Good location
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Cost of the valet. Good: Location to the garden
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: (Valet) parking is expensive. Room was a bit small. Good: Very pleasant experience. The room was good, clean and had a rich minibar. Very nice bar/restaurant/breakfast accomodation. Personell (we were helped by luckas) was extraordinary kind and helpful."
Boston,The Boxer,Good: Beautiful rooms and amenities - L'occitane products. The restaurant Finch great food and amazing bar. Loved the Boxer
Boston,The Boxer,Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.
Boston,The Boxer,"Good: The room was very comfortable, great for a couple. We had a wonderful time, it was very conveniently located to the TD Garden, which is where we were attending a concert. It was also very close to the North End and Faneuil hall, which is a great area to visit for food options that are very plentiful."
Boston,The Boxer,the breakfast at 17 bucks was a bit of disgrace. it is a particular building.
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: We had booked 2 rooms for our 3 night Boston trip - King Room for us and a Double Double (ie with 2 double beds) for our teenagers. I booked this in December for our July visit. I emailed twice before arrival to request that the rooms were close by (on the same floor) and both times got no reply - and that should have alerted me and to be honest sums up 'Boxer Customer Service'. On arrival we were told that there were no rooms available with 2 beds, the guy on reception seemed clueless how to help us. Our teenagers were supposedly 'upgraded' to a suite where my son had to sleep on a sofa / pull out bed (or share a King size bed with his sister). Totally unacceptable - I booked these rooms 6 months in advance. All in all we had interactions with 4 different staff members (including someone from Accounts who had to process a compensation refund) and at no time did either my wife nor I feel like the Customer . . . . you know the kind The PAYING Customer! So in terms of Comfort score - low because my son was on a sofa bed for 3 nights. In terms of Value for Money - low 1800 and my 16 year old son gets a sofa bed In terms of Staff score - low because they are in serious need of some Customer Service training. Good: The Boxer in Boston SHOULD be a fantastic hotel - it's a great building, location is excellent (we were able to explore everything that Boston has to offer from there), rooms are a good size but overall our stay was not as good as it should have been. Came away from our 3 night stay (planned and booked 6 months earlier) just feeling like we had been let down . . . ."
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: poor room comfort no room for clothes very old bath accesories high price.
Boston,The Boxer,"Good: The whole 5 day experience at the hotel was superb- the room,staff and location were all perfect- thank you The Boxer second time staying with you and all requirements were met."
Boston,The Boxer,The location
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Parking a little expensive.. Good: Close to TD Garden
Boston,The Boxer,Fitness center small and not well equipped. Good location.
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Nothing. Good: The hotel was simply excellent. The coolest hotel I have ever stayed!
Boston,The Boxer,"I didn't like the size of the rooms, not as big as I thought they would be. I liked the central location to Downtown Boston."
Boston,The Boxer,"Good: Very quaint hotel, good location, great staff...amazing time!"
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: We had breakfast on two days in the hotel. One day (Sunday) the service was great - the next day it was very poor. While the hotel is quite central, the choice of restaurants very close to the hotel is not good. Good: Front desk staff were friendly and happy to give advice etc. Nice hotel with funky rooms. Room we had was a bit noisy at night - can turn the fridge off but still noise from air con or something else."
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: This is really not a reflection on the hotel but the valet parking does take a long time to retrieve your car. They tell you to allow 30 minutes and you really need to do that. Good: Friendly staff. Clean rooms.
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Paying for parking. Good: Friendly and prompt service.
Boston,The Boxer,"Good: Perfection - beautiful rooms, comfortable beds, great style. Centrally located for all the fun things in downtown Boston."
Boston,The Boxer,"Good: The hotel environment, the staff went above and beyond to make our first trip to Boston better than we expected. Recommendations they made, help with directions, very friendly, didnt feel like a hotel, felt like staying with friends. Comfortable beds, cozy room, great food."
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Room size. Good: The close proximity to TD garden
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Room was small. Good: Free apples and fruit Infused Water in the lobby. Free bikes.
Boston,The Boxer,"Good: A marvelous location, very friendly crew, it's clear hotel where you feel you are in Boston!"
Boston,The Boxer,Good: Its location.
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: The pull out couch was extremely uncomfortable. Good: Room was great. Staff was friendly and welcoming.
Boston,The Boxer,Room too small and ice machine broke nice too small rooms Free water and apples
Boston,The Boxer,the bed was very comfortable
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: Sofa bed very uncomfortable. Good: Great restoration of classic building close to sports, shopping and financial district."
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Room too small and ice machine broke nice too small rooms. Good: Free water and apples
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: The pillows were very flat and uncomfortable, and there was no real blanket on the bed!. Good: Location, staff, aesthetics, price."
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: I think the hotel could do more to promote the on site restaurant with newly arrived guests. My husband tried it and thought the food was great but if there'd been a deal or something to catch our attention I'm sure we'd have eaten breakfast there both mornings of our stay. I also think that although the space inside the rooms seems to be well used that there are some practical challenges with storage where existing space could be better used for the ease and comfort of guests. Good: Very comfortable beds. Not massive but cosy and we all slept well. The linens were clean and fresh and we enjoyed the L'Occitane products in the bathroom. The staff were friendly, kind and helpful."
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: The room lacked hanging space and was quite small. Good: The staff were friendly and helpful. The bar and restaurant were nice
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: The minibar and the heating were noisy, but it didn't really disrupt our sleep. Breakfast was good, but perhaps the avocado toast was a bit small for the price. Good: The staff were all friendly and professional. Our room was clean and warm (it was cold out!) and had everything we needed. The drinks and food were very good, especially the Finch burger and the crab bennies at breakfast. Overall, we really liked the feel of the hotel and would definitely stay again, especially if we were going out of North Station again which is just around the corner."
Boston,The Boxer,Good: The location was perfect for walking to everything
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: Shower didn't drain propery, was puddle in shower when we checked in. Someone else's shower water left over, very gross. Good: Very friendly staff."
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Room servicing late in the day. Good: Great hotel. Friendly staff.
Boston,The Boxer,Nothing Very friendly staff and very helpful
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: The restaurant was closed for a refurb and as a result we had to eat our breakfast in the lobby on our knees. We had tiny plastic plates and plastic cutlery and a poor food choice . I was not informed by booking.com that this was the case . It was not the service we wanted for 675 dollars for 2 nights!!. Good: The room was good
Boston,The Boxer,"Bad: the room was not very big and a couple more hooks here and there would have been nice to hang coat, towels etc. Good: nice decoration, well located"
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Just want to say paying 330 for one night would have been nice too get breakfast included in the price. . Good: At least it wasnt too far from TD garden.
Boston,The Boxer,The bed was uncomfortable It was close walking distance to everything
Boston,The Boxer,"Good: Staff was great, room small but clean and organized well. Location to TD Garden and restaurants awesome."
Boston,The Boxer,Good: Perfect location if you're attending an even at the Garden. Very short walk
Boston,The Boxer,Good: Great location. Extremely comfortable bed and pillows. Wonderful friendly staff.
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: The bed platforms! Perhaps if they were painted white they would become part of the bed and maybe missed a little more! They are now the colour of the carpet - beware!. Good: The staff! Very helpful and welcoming and happy! Loved the L'octaine toiletries. Free bikes were a good idea too but it rained during my visit.
Boston,The Boxer,Bad: Buffet food.
New Orleans,The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,"Loved this place! If you are looking for a chain hotel, THIS IS NOT for you. If you are looking for different, unique, friendly, fun...then this is it. We chose the little room with Queen bed, no windows..and it was GREAT. Best bed I've slept in while traveling in a long long time. Although there are internal hotel noises every once and a while..it was by no means disturbing or loud. Location was awesome! We mainly hung out on Decatour street/Jackson square/French market..but even bourbon street was a short walk. Hotel staff is very knowledgeable about places to eat and things to do. We didn't drive here so no idea about parking or valet. Staff was extremely friendly. It's just a super little gem in a crazy town."
New Orleans,The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,"Great hotel. So much more character than staying in one of the big chain hotels. The building was a transformed warehouse, so walls are old brick, floors are resurfaced wood, etc. Very Cool. Super helpful staff. Great coffee shop restaurant downstairs. Definitely will return."
New Orleans,The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,Nice hotel with a great restaurant! Only thing that would have been nice to have it a bathtub rather than just a shower.
New Orleans,The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,"Pros- Great customer service, comfortable beds, clean rooms, fantastic room style/decor and safe area. Cons- no pool, no meals available, just a few pastry type items at the bar/lobby"
New Orleans,The Old No. 77 Hotel & Chandlery,"The young, hip hotel guests probaby cringed when they saw me schlep my 4, 6, and 8 year olds through the front door and I immediately realized our family was not the hotel's target demographic, but we LOVED this place. As a former New Orleans resident, this is as local as you can get. Compar Lapin was unbelievable and my children could not get enough of their homemade pasta and gnocchi and probably would have gone home with our server, Clare (that is how much they liked her). The head cocktail crafter, Abby, was super friendly and insanely adorable and her staff was extremely talented and helpful. The room was so comfortable my children slept almost two hours past their norm, which was probably appreciated by the majority of guests who had been tearing up their livers the night before. We did not use maid service so my only suggestion would be a little more counter space in the bath and more towels. Other than that, it was perfect."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: Better return from the slots!!. Good: Bed excellent, pillows good, shower good with strong flow and hot. Very well maintained public spaces with lots of wood panelling. The piece of the Berlin Wall was quite interesting and all at a very good price."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Thumping music all night long. So loud the windows vibrated.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Losing money lol. Good: I like the attitude and service from the staff...i enjoy the atmosphere and the food
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Good: The staff at the place is extremely friendly.Paradise Restaurant buffet good selection, good food, and reasonable cost."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The room I booked was a non-smoking but when we got to the hotel, the gentleman at the counter said they didn't have any and have not had any available for several days. The guy then said that in order for me to get my money back, I'd have to go through the third party that I booked the room through. Good: Nothing"
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,Good: HELPFUL STAFF
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: That the tv would not switch to the input channel. I wasn't able to use the HDMI port on the TV. Good: The company I had with me. Lol
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Good: Best gambling in Vegas and best comps! Brewery is great, rooms very clean, staff is wonderful. I only stay at Main Street."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: I still really hate the cigarette smoke in the casino. But other then that (and all the crazies on the fremont experience at night) its fun and awesome!. Good: Location was perfect for our leisure trip. Free valet parking is always amazing (of course we tipped every time we picked up and dropped off our car!) The amount of things to do on the Fremont Experience is endless! What an awesome experience. Truly the 9th island for Hawaiians like us! We love it!
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: 1st - PARKING LOT **BAD,BAD,BAD** This is 2017, nobody need driver to parking car, unless you're 85 yrs old (should not even drive). But drivers that steals quarters from your rental car, this is very low. 2nd - They asked a deposit of 100. Because I was planning to get it back, I used a BC and not a CC. On check out I was informed that it will take 1 to 2 days. Should I trust on it 3rd - If you sleep on that room 512 and need a AC on, make sure you are deaf or use to leave near NY freeway. The noise of that machine it's worst than sleep on LV international airport at 9am with your windows car open. Will I stay on this hotel again NEVER. Good: Location, access to shopping, and cleanning"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Dirty and old room. Valet parking is not comfortable. Casino is old and has no roulette. If you have a car, you can stay, cause the price is everything. Good: Pretty cheap for Las Vegas"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The hotel is very tired - could use an update. Now, I understand why such a deal. Can not figure out higher rating given to it overall. Good: Location was in the middle of the Freemont Experience."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: Not much. Good: For several years, a group of us has met for the SEMA SHOW. We have always come over a day early, and met for fun and dinner at your 777 Microbrewery. This time we were booked at MAIN STREET STATION as well.We'll be back, particularly since you didn't charge resort fees."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,Bad: Check out was too slow. Good: Buffet was excellent
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: To be honest, nothing to complain about. Just too bad that there wasn't any free wifi in the rooms. Good: Considering that we only paid 88 dollars for 2 persons for 2 nights, this was great value for money. The hotel is located in the middle of Fremont Street, so you just step outside and you are in the middle of the action. Our room was on the 9th floor and we didn't hear any noise whatsoever. The room was maybe a bit old fashioned, but still offered everything you need. We were positively surprised that we had access to the pool and gym of the California hotel. We just needed to walk 2 mins to access their facilities. The gym was really good equipped for a hotel gym. Pool was really nice and quiet. Would definitely stay here again!"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: This room is straight out of a horror film. Good: I like Fremont st
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: nothing!. Good: buffet is excellant! room are clean, great view of mountains and saw fireworks in distance."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: access to parking. Good: the location
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,Bad: Very satisfied.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The place was falling apart, the tub was cracked and broken. the bathroom shelf was barely holding on. The bed was extremely tough to sleep on. Good: I liked that it was close to entertainment. The shower held a hot water temperature for a long time."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Bathroom was small, noisy outside. Good: Location, beds, price"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The parking garage is so hard to find. I passed it at least two times trying to find it. You also can't self park, which is a hassle coming back from being out and about. You have to rush to gather all of your belongings, souvenirs, etc, because the entry bay to the garage will hold two cars at most. You can't dilly dally. Hope that makes sense. Only paid WiFi,which was a big bummer. The express snack bar/grill staff were very unfriendly. Every time I went to the buffet, the line to be seated was always sooo long. I never did end up eating there for that reason. Good: Near all of the Fremont Street Experience stuff."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: smokey air out of elevators. Good: valet parking with security-
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Not sure about deluxe room i was in. Good: Location
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Good: Close proximity to Freemont Street Experience.
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,Bad: missed not having a pool or somewhere to sit out and read. we were next to the railway so the train was noisy but we got used to it. Good: loved the food. beds very comfortable. excellent value.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: I lost roulette. Good: Buffet bb
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The bathroom needs to be upgraded. It is very worn, the brown wall paper was dirty and the paint on the sink counter was pealing off. was also disappointed the room did not have a coffee maker. I like to have a cup while I get dressed in the mornings. would have liked a non-smoking area in the casino. I am a non-smoker and I had to keep taking breaks and go outside for fresh air. Good: The Beds were great! The location was very good. The gentleman at the Registration desk was very helpful and friendly. And the Lady at the Keno lounge was nice too."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: Not so quiet during the night, since it's really close to highway. Good: The beds were very confortable. The parking was for free, and the location close the Fremont street."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The beds were not too comfortable. Good: I really liked its location, and slot machines, the Paradise Buffet, and Duncan Donuts place within the Fremont Hotel."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: The elevator to the parkade requires some maintenance - at least a wet mop to kill whatever is lurking on the floor!. Good: This resort hotel is amazing - the location in perfect, the rooms are huge, and absolutely spotless!"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Limited TV channels and no refrigerator or coffee making facility in room. Good: The free parking at the hotel was great and all the staff were very helpful and polite.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Small restroom. Good: Clean room with a great view.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Even though we got a non smoking room it still smelled like smoke. Good: Valet parking Duncan doughnut
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The hotel bathroom should be remodeled as the bathtub looks quite old. The drain gets clogged easily, and the basin tap handle looks like it is about to fall apart. No free WiFi. No fridge. And even no coffee-maker/kettle. Good: Good location with a few minutes walk to the Mob museum. The hotel is located in the heart of Fremont Experience. Both northbound and southbound bus stops are just beside the hotel building. Besides, the staffs are quite friendly. The buffet was satisfactory, and the price is cheap due to the 10 off for guests every meal."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: It was hard to get into the parking area because of traffic (an event was going on) no coffee pot in the room. I like to sit and drink coffee for and hour or so before doing anything for the day. I'm not paying 3.00 per cup of coffee. Other than that it was ok. Good: It was a beautiful hotal
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Nothing. Good: Location on Fremont
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Rooms small, air conditioning don't work!!."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Old, not many outlets. Good: Location and price."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: No business center..wifi wasnt free..it asked for ten bucks...the internet kiosk was 650 for 30 mins..but deducted 20 mins to print boarding passes and no shuttle to airport. Good: Location
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: I was in room 314, and its very noisy at night with the street ambiance, so dont expect to sleep before 2AM. I had to take my breakfast to adjacent hotels as continental / seated proper breakfast was not available (or couldnt find it...). Good: The bed was confortable and the location is just amazing on Fremont street."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: Main Street Station recently implemented paid parking (I stayed last week and it was still free). Although parking is free for hotel guests, they have not worked the kinks out of the system. We almost missed our flight due to being unable to leave the lot. Security had to be called and that person told us that there have been a large number of similar episodes. They need to FIX this!. Good: Everything EXCEPT the parking."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: none.
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: Th e food wasnt that good. Good: The breakfast buffett was good, the other 2 restaurants were just fair, in fact in one of them I got sick with the food."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Good: The rooms were very comfortable, clean, and well maintained"
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,Bad: There's nothing not to like here. Though the maid service was good but they are kind of early to knock at the door for cleaning service. They're there at 8am and we were still in dreamland that we were forced to get up and open the door to talk to them to clean later. Good: We love our very spacious room though we didn't have a single king sized bed. They gave us twin beds but it's fine. The Garden court buffet was also great! It was very affordable. We almost eat there everyday because of its price. Please keep it that way.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The airconditioner in the room did not work, and it made a very loud sound all night. We told the front desk and they were able to fix it for the next night stay. It's understandable because the hotel itself is very old. We would probably stay in a different hotel when we go back. Good: Staff was very helpful and nice. Tony Romo's restaurant was very good."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Bed was not comfortable - they need to replace the mattress. Good: Room was clean.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The entire place smells like an ashtray. The rooms were small and the place is noisy. It's a complete freak show under the canopy---ugly people who are 90 nude with no talent. Wall to wall beggars and hawkers. The entire Las Vegas is full of annoying street hustlers and creeps. What a waste of our First Amendment Rights! Next time I go to LV, I will stay in a South Vegas Hotel, go to a show and leave the next day. Too bad Vegas is stuck with such a beggar and homeless problem. Good: It was on my bucket list and I wanted to experience the canopy light show---ok, check it off. Good deals on food: Tony Roma's is located within the Fremont Hotel and steak and lobster for 11.99 is a DEAL! The Valet Parking was free and excellent. The entire Staff was excellent but seemed embarrassed to be in such a dump. It was cheap but you pay for it if your not a smoker."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The bathroom is very small, smaller than I am used to. The saimin noodle soup at the cafe was terrible, the noodles were mushy and blend. Good: Location was right. The buffet was so so. The food at the cafe was okay. The rooms are kind of small but okay."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: The pool was not at the hotel had to go to another hotel to swim and that is not stated when your booking your room. Just make it clear that there is not a pool at the hotel other than that loved the hotel!. Good: Great place to stay
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: in old town, far away from new main strip noisy air-con in room decor abit old. Good: cheap buffet with good quality big room comfort bed"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The bed was stiff and valet parking only. Wifi is pay only and didn't live up to the speed expectations as advertised. Good: The location is great, easy access to all of Fremont area with a short walk. Not being a giant casino you don't have to walk far from the car or through the place to get out."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: Extremely disappointed in Fremont Street. It used to be my favorite place to play/stay in Vegas but I will not be back. Very strange people just standing in the middle of the street. Cartoon characters, men in thongs and even one in an adult diaper! It's Hollywood Blvd on steroids! Thanks for the memories, Downtown Las Vegas. The Fremont Street Experience is one I do not wish to repeat!. Good: The hotel was very nice, much nicer than The Plaza next door."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: My room was near the ventilation system and there was a lot a noise coming from that. Good: Excelent location in the freemont Experience.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: There were a couple younger staff at the desk during mid day times that seemed bothered by questions. Good: Easy to park. The room was clean and cool. Valet staff was really nice. Steve the maintence man was amazing. I dropped my pearl earring down the bathroom sink. He took the time to take the loop of the drain and get my pearl earring back. I was grateful for his extra service and care.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Waitress didn't come around a lot even with tipping. The hotel was older and had some cosmetic problems. Good: Lots to around the property and decent food prices. The buffet was really good.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: When we left there was a valet parking worker that made us put are luggage on the cart. But other than we had an awsome time there. Good: The location and the restaurants were great I enjoyed the buffet!
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Rude staff. Cleaniness. Bed. Had to change rooms three times. I will never stay there again!. Good: Nothing
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Good: Good hotel at Fremont street. But do not expect something special. Relatively old rooms, no WIFI in the rooms, but the bed was comfortable, the staff was nice, and the Hotel is direct in the heart of Old Las Vegas."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: Pricey, but it was fathers day weekend. Good: Access to downtown"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: No pool. Good: Every thing was walking distance
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Dirty, tiny bathroom and no pool. Good: Prime rib meal deal at Roma's"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: A fridge in the room would be super nice. Good: The room was very clean, beds comfy and 3 pillows. Every one was friendly. Great valet staff."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: The bar is a little on the expensive side. Drinks are very small for the price. The bartender we had was very slow and not very friendly. We waited about 10 minutes before we were served. It wasn't busy either. Good: Staff was very nice and helpful. The location of the hotel is very convenient.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: I loved everything. The parking, the restaurant ,the rooms and the the several acts that perform every night in the downtown area. Good: The people at the front desk were superb. They upgraded me to a real nice room."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: the noise fm the live bands when trying to sleep.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Might need a little updating. Good: Conveniently located on Fremont
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Better meal choices. Pool and fitness center on property. Good: Ease of conveniece to everything I needed
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,Bad: That I had to leave great place. Good: Everything very nice room food service
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,Bad: There is handicap parking for checking in but not close after checking in. Good: Everything was convenient and costs of the buffet were not bad. Prices in the restaurant were affordable.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: My money was stolen at the valet... room was dirty and had to get another then key card didn't work for new room. Manager did his best but I was disappointed. Good: Location

Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Shower Tub clogged. Good: Convenient location. Reasonable food prices. Awesome selection of cuisine. Helpful staff!
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Hassle checking in confirmation email lost by bookings or Fremont hotel had my email almost didn't use mine scary .
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Rude staff. Couldnt find our reservations waited 2 hrs to confirm eventhough prepaid..rooms not cleaned. Got smoking instead of non smoking. Will not be staying there anytime soon not. Good: Location
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Room was a lot smaller than I expected, and seemed a bit rundown. Not to mention we were supposed to be on a floor that was nonsmoking. The floor smelled of a smoking lounge. Good: Location and staff were awesome. Had a great view of Freemont street from our room."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: wifi is chargeable. Good: location, casino was cheap, food is just in the hotel (buffet, donuts, etc)"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: needs to be updated a bit forsure. Good: i like that they upgraded our room for one night the beds were very comfy and staff were great and we felt very safe after what happened
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Only thing I would have changed is the climate control. It did not go anywhere near as high as I would like for it to go. Maybe it was just my room, but definitely could have been cooler. Good: Got more than what I expected from this hotel! They let me choose what floor I wanted to be on, which I've never gotten from anywhere else. Location is PRIME. Fremont Street is right outside their doors! The room is just like any other average hotel. It was very clean and comfortable. Michael Ovalles was very helpful in showing us around. He also helped us get our player cards and a complimentary deck of cards to enjoy our stay!"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: The shower didnt drain. The pillows were horrible. My feet stuck to the carpet in the room. Good: Location

Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Valet scrapped my car on the wall and no fridge in the room. Good: It was clean and close to everything!
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Non smoking rooms smelt like smoke and just all the cigerate smoke throughout hotel. And room drains slow draining. Good: I liked the lanai restaurant and valet parking
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: The wait to enter the buffet was too long never got in the whole week.. When I went to the other restaraunt I was told I couldn't order certain items as they are for happy hour only so I left. They also did not have a pool or any alternative except travel 18 miles to their other facility and use their pool. They never even gave me a discount for lack of this facitilityor even notifying me as I made my reservation months in advance, I also did not like having to park outside of the parking garage only cause I was riding a motorcycle the parking garage was for cars only. I felt as though I was a second class citizen, no laundry facility service or machines . Good: The location was good and the staff especially the cleaning of my room was great."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: Short staffed at the registration desk. Good: Great location and price was right
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: It's not the hotels fault, but the sirens on the street woke me up. Good: The best bed I've slept in besides the one at home! Enjoyed all the pillows! Even though the hotel is older, the room was fine! The bathroom was generous, with a good shower."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The cleanliness wasn't the best. One of our towels and bed sheets had red stains on them which the staff informed us was rust, and not blood....upon arrival the toilet wouldn't flush as well. We got stuck in a smoking room even though we didn't book a smoking room. The noise was unbearable, and when combined with the smoke just added up to disaster. Good: Close to the public transportation systems. In the middle of downtown Las Vegas."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: No self parking.. had to reach down to flush toilet. Good: Location
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: The bathroom was gross. The inside of the tub was peeling.The ceiling looks as if it had a previous flood upstairs. Good: The buffet was good.The location of the hotel was great.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: We liked everything. Good: The beds were comfortable the rooms were clean
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Good: The location was easily accessible to any downtown activities and the strip, we went to the pinball neon museum and the fremont street experience in one day. It was great"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Old outdated rooms, even though its a classic hotel does not mean they dont have to put forth effort to modernize rooms. Good: Was right in Fremont street"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: One of the things we did not like was the fact that we couldn't wake up to a cup of coffee in the morning without paying an arm and a leg for one. The other was that they should at least offer free coffee and beverages to their customers. Washington State casino have a coffee and soda machines for their customers to enjoy as they play. I also do not like the idea of casinos shoving resorts fees down a person throat when they know that the percentage of customers do not use the resorts. Good: I enjoyed the friendly staff.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Good: The hotel room was spacious and very comforting.....
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: We hated the window were fake. Good: I liked the location the most
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: The room needs to be updated. The bathroom fixtures needs to be renovated. The layout of the room was a little a awkward, there needs to be better lighting and a vanity under the large mirror. The property itself could use use an update as well, it needs to be modernized. Good: It was close to all the activities on Fremont Street. I enjoyed being in the center of Downtown, everything was within walking distance."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: The bed was too soft for my mate and we need more pillows. They were happy to provide the additional pillows. Good: The entire staff was very nice. The room was clean and we stayed on the north-side and did not hear any noise from Fremont Street.
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,"Bad: Street noise. Good: Decor, table games, dining"
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: No wifi in the rooms in 2017. Good: Great location! Friendly staff and you can buy your breakfast in the casino. There is no free Wifi in the rooms, but you can enjoy free Wifi in the lobby. Room was spacious enough and linnens were clean. Room looked like it was recently updated and we enjoyed our stay."
Las Vegas,Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel,Bad: Nothing . Good: Really nice casino brew pub hotel rooms were massive and clean great location for fremount street and affordable drink and food prices easy to get to the strip using local transport
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: the entire atmosphere of being downtown Las Vegas. Good: Everything was very convenient to get to.
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,Bad: That I couldn't stay longer because of work. Good: All the lights and the view
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: I guess the lack of facilities in the modern world. No pool, hot tub, gym. We got lost a few times walking down stairs, even went into their staff lounge and kitchen by accident. No free wifi anywhere! 10 a day per device.... Good: We loved being in the center of action and its great value. All the staff were very helpful."
Las Vegas,Fremont Hotel & Casino,"Bad: Beds were very hard and lumpy, rooms and hallways smelled of smoke and the AC cooled barely. Good: Ease of access to multiple things, great places to eat."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Had some trouble regulating the water temperature in the shower. Good: The use of space was excellent and the room and the bed very comfortable.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: Courteous and helpful staff! Excellent location. Close to prudential and shopping. Highly recommend
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Breakfast was missing protein. Only bagels and donuts. Good: Location! Location! Location!
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: The breakfast was minimal. The rooms were tiny. There wasn't a workout room. Good: The room location was at the back of the hotel and quiet.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Rooms were pretty small, definitely not suited for a family but great for a couple. Good: Great location, Comfortable rooms, breakfast was good (beagles, cream cheese, donuts and coffee.)"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast pretty modest but I could leave with that!. Good: Excellent location next to attractions, commercial area, everything. Friendly and helpful staff. The room was not big but well equipped. Good price for Boston which is an expensive city."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Very expensive hotel relative to services eg Breakfast is repetitive and very weighted to carbohydrates. No skimmed milk, only half and half. Lounge area a little jaded, perhaps Remember to add in the tax etc as this significantly adds to the cost of the hotel. Good: The location is central to a range of must-see sights"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Room is on the small side. I was on one of the back rooms. There are no views and other buildings can see inside your room since windows are high. Breakfast is not attended and no hot option. Very narrow corridors. Good: The decor of the room is very modern and pleasing with sound equipment for those that want to listen to music with speakers on the wall. Floor of shower is non-slippery. Decor of the bathroom is also very nice. Location is outstanding with Copley subway station accross the street as well as bus stop. Restuarants and shops in Newbury Street one block away. Bagels and donuts in breakfast were fresh.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: noisy room heater/AC unit. Good: location, small comfortable room."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Good: Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. Good breakfast, nice to have a lounge to sit and read the newspapers provided. Stored luggage until we were ready to leave. Would stay again."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: I didn't see that there was breakfast available at the hotel. Good: Location was amazing!!!! Room was a little tight for two but very nice
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: parking. Good: BREAKFAST AND THE BAR WERE REAL NICE........BARTENDER chris ..great guy
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Good: My wife and I stayed at the charlesmark for 4 days. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating. Room was a little small, but very clean and modern."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: Location is fabulous. Got there very early and was able to check in! Room was clean and modern. Love this hotel!
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Good: Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Outlook from room. Good: Staff helpfulness Well designed use of limited space
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Maybe it was just my room but the fridge was kind of hard to reach. Good: I loved the room I was in. The hotel itself is gorgeous and the room was quite cozy. The location was perfect as well. I would definitely stay here again.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Parking is available at a parking garage a few streets away if you use the one recommended by the hotel. The rate the hotel give you is not the lowest rate you can get, I parked at the same parking lot for less using a parking app. It is worth looking into this if you are driving. Secondly, make sure you try and get a room with a queen bed. The doubles are tiny and this was my only regret with staying at this hotel. The location of the property is excellent. Easy to get to from the freeway, and easy to walk to Boston Common, restaurants, bars and local tourist attractions. Staff were very helpful on arrival and during the stay. No expense was spared in the room in terms of technology (had hard wired speakers even in the bathroom). Not sure they are needed, but was a nice touch. Rooms were clean, bathrooms small but had everything you need and was nice to have a shower not standing over a bath for once."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: There was NOTHING we disliked! The room was small but that was to be expected and the two of us were very comfortable there. The room size and the narrow hallways gave the entire place the European feel... nothing wrong with that, right. Good: 1. Outstanding location! Close to the T, the airport shuttle, historic churches, Public Library (also an attraction in itself), Prudential SkyDeck, the amazing Newbury St. with all the shops and restaurants... I could go on and on. 2. Excellent staff - attentive, helpful, understanding, flexible... overall very pleasant without being over the top. 3. A small place that felt like home, without that big corporate hotel feel. 4. A good continental breakfast that never ran out of any items. 5. Free WiFi that ran very well. 6. Reliable cooling/heating system. 7. All the small details such as nice toiletry items, modern plumbing, detachable shower head, hairdryer, iron, a huge mirror... Thank you, CharlesMark! We hope to stay there again."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Highly recommend. Good: Modern style, great location, super helpful staff, continental breakfast included, great value, clean"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: staff r not helpful at all, room was really soooooo tiny even I booked large room, but the staff gave me two options,, if I want the large room I booked,,,, I have to go up a stair with my luggages, then down a stair again with my luggage to the basement, then walk through a hall way to reach my large room,,, or get a tiny one so I can use the elevator and make it easier for me to reach a room with all my luggages. really Bad experience,, I paid 200 a day for this SH,, I would Pay only 160 at Bellagio LAS VEGAS and get the best service in stars hotel,,,better than this hotel charlesMark. dont book this hotel Pals in case u have other options. Good: location"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Size of room. Good: Leaving
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: I don't really know why this hotel has such a high rating. It's decent, but definitely not worth 3* and 300+ I paid for the room. Nothing in particular, but just the entire feel and look of it was more in the 2*, 150-200 range. Also, there were some road works taking place just outside the hotel at 7AM that produced insufferable noise, so I wish I had known that before booking."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Nothing to dislike awesome stay. Good: Really liked the modern feel to the place ! Nice looking spot, so I kinda look like a bum when I travel so not to attract crime or Theves . And I usually travel around walking and exploring so I travel light aka bum looking ... the staff was very friendly to me . The room was awesome nice touches classical music playing after a shower and some music I was rejuvenated and went to the bar an had great conversation really a good memory to my trip I'd defiantly stay here again like the small hotel appeal . Great stay ."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Price did not fit the size of the room. It felt more like a cubicle. Good: The room was nice and clean, came with safe, and fridge."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Strange drainage smell when entering the reception area Loved the location and friendly staff
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: great location breakfast
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: The breakfast was good and the bedroom was comfortable.It was within walking distance of the freedom trail.There was also a shuttle bus to the airport within walking distance.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Walls are very thin - we could hear upstairs and next door neighbors. The breakfast was very basic. Good: The location was great. Easy access to T. Nice bathroom.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Tiny grim, room with a full size bed for my husband and myself which was way too small.If you opened the window ( onto an airshaft) the food smell from the neighboring restaurant were terrible. Good: the location"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: The breakfast was good but there could've been more variety to it. Good: The location was amazing! I also liked the fact that the hotel was very cosy.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: The room/bed were a little small and the room was quite gloomy, very little natural light and the lighting wasn't great. Would have also preferred tea/coffee in the room rather that the large stereo/DVD system but that's just personal preference. Good: Great location, and friendly staff. Nice bar."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: I liked the breakfeast like swedish buffet
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Provided breakfast is just bagels and doughnuts + tea/coffee. I'm not sure how that qualifies as continental! Beds are very small but OK for a relatively small couple - would be uncomfortable if you are much over 6 feet. Rooms are small but that's the only way you are getting a room at this price in this location. Good: Location is excellent (we walked everywhere including from Boston Back Bay station to the hotel with our bags - it's a 10min walk), staff were friendly, rooms are small but reasonably well appointed, hotel and rooms were very clean."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Closest parking was a 4-5 minute walk away for 28 overnight. Closer parking is available for 48 overnight. Good: Great neighborhood on Boylston and a block from Newbury St. Plenty of restaurants and bars within walking distance to choose from. It is one of the better values compared to other hotels in Boston. Half a block from the Copley T station if you want to get to another part of the city. 15- 20 minute walk to Fenway Park for the Sox game.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Bed is too small for two people and the blanket is too thin. The staff are just ok not very friendly though. Good: Location and the New England style building and the room is cute.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Room and bed were tiny - not even a queen bed. Bed took up most of the room. Breakfast was coffee and a bunch of cold bagels. Bathroom was also tiny. Not worth the exhorbitant price at all. Good: Location was good.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Heater didn't work, so the room was very cold. Room wifi was crazy slow, so I couldn't use it AT ALL. Staffs were lazy and rude, especially when they call. Good: Location. Center boston"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: Bathroom was large and the speakers in the wall
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: I didn't like the siE of the rooms cozy but to small. Good: I liked the comfort of a small room the location and the staff that was working there
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: The fan in our room made a ticking sound throughout the night which was annoying. Also, there are not many choices for food. A couple of flat breads are offered for dinner. Breakfast is more reasonable with pastries, bagels, and fruit. Good: The bed was very comfortable. The space in the room was well used. Very clean. I loved the exposed brick throughout the halls, and that actual keys are given out, not key cards. Great location and staff."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Too pricy, very basic for what you pay for. Good: Nice staff, good continental breakfast included. Excellent location."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Room too small. Late check in at 15:00. Good: Excellent location and the staff was super polite. WiFi was working good. Check out at 12:00 was very convenient for me. Storage area provided.close by the center with all lot of coffees and bars around.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"One of the room maids kept forgetting to leave sufficient quantities of basic toiletries and the quality of bathroom cleaning could have been better. Very friendly receptionist personnel, special thanks to Jesse! Nice view to the Library, added to the room booking for free. Plenty of varied places to eat out within a few mins walk from the hotel, catering for all choices."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: The breakfast is nothing special. Parking is 30 per each 24Hrs.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Breakfast - hardly adequate. Good: Location and value for that location. Easy to get to - right across from bus station to/from Logan airport. Room was small but comfortable and updated.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: The rooms are tiny, but expensive. The staff was not very friendly or helpful. They seemed bored and not so welcoming to visitors. They didnt refill the coffee thermos for breakfast and didnt care to either. It was awkward. Good: The place is clean and centrally located. I enjoyed the music playing in the room upon arrival. Its been updated although its an old building."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: The wifi connection in my room was loose and disconnected during the Inauguration weekend. But the nightclerk (red-haired Irish lass) tried very hard to fix it for me. In the morning William 3 came in and tried to fix it.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: breakfast is normal. Good: I am very satisfied this hotel.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Breakfast is very poor. Good: Room was very comfortable. Ideally positionned.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Good: We liked everything about this hotel from the moment we arrived till we left. We were greeted by Mia a very friendly and helpful receptionist. We were given a lovely room overlooking the Boston marathon finishing line with views of the Trinity church and Boston public library. We found our room to be very clean with plenty of space and a very comfortable bed and a great sound system.On our first night we went to their wine and cheese tasting event which we found to be great fun and a great way to mingle with the locals. The staff play a great role in the success of this hotel under the brilliant management of the very hospitable Jefferson who by the way makes a great cocktail especially our favorite the Bloody Mary. We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel as it is right beside public transport (T) and the airport shuttle drops you across the street. We also found we could walk to most of the tourist sights. The complimentary continental breakfast was a bonus. Thanks Charlesmark for a great few days, hope to visit you again in the near future"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Room was very small and not comftorable for two people. It felt like a third the size of a standard hotel room with just enough space to walk around the bed and a chair in the corner. Bathroom is super small. View from our main floor window was a sketchy back alley with construction. Included breakfast is bagels, donuts and fruit, don't expect a warm meal.Our first night we asked the person at the front desk if there was any pubs or places close by to have a drink. He said he didn't think so... Well the next night we were out exploring the city and found half a dozen bars, restaurants and pubs a block away on the same street and discovered we were a block away from the famous Newbury street! All in all I feel like this hotel is over priced, unimpressive and uncomfortable. Good: The location of the Charlesmark is great for tourists and people wanting to be in a good spot to transit around but feel safe and enjoy some night life"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Super slow wifi, Comcast kept getting stuck and I would have to wait about 45 seconds just for the channel to change - wish there's was at least oatmeal for breakfast. Good: Location - room - clean - right in front of public library of Boston"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: The room was very small and dark. Bathroom was large. The window faced an alleyway. Good: Amazing location and great price, clean room and nice staff."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Too expensive for what offered Location and staff
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: Fantastic location right near Copley Square and directly above marathon finish line.

Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: The pillows were flat. Good: It was a great location close to everything. The bathroom was newly remodeled and beautiful! The bed was average but I got good night's sleep.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: The room was right off the elevator so you could hear everyone coming off of it. Good: The bathroom was very nice. The shower has great water pressure and the shower head is adjustable.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: The parking garage was farther than we thought, was inconvenient but realize its a city and parking is always difficult. I would of liked valet service and would of paid more happily for it. Good: Yes it's small put clearly stated and really set up well. Was very fresh and updated not to mention clean. Would defiantly stay here again on our next visit. The staff in the evening was very efficient and helpful."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast was inadequate, no protein. Small bathroom. No luggage cart. Good: Location and discount parking. Clean with nice staff. Near subway station and Newbury St. with lots of good restaurants within walking distance."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: Loved the sound system in the room and the fact that they have coffee all the time!
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: The TV was on in the lounge during breakfast, tuned to GMA and Kelly Ripa-terrible shows, too loud, couldn't find a remote. It would be better on close caption with no sound or another channel, or have the remote so that breakfasters can change it. Thanks!. Good: Atmosphere. Location."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: sheets seemed unwashed and old item from previous occupant was still in closet.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Breakfast was not very large for the price of the hotel. Good: Everything about this place was great!
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: The room was really small. With two large suitcases, we could hardly move in it. Good: Location, staff, bar with complimentary drinks"

Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Small room. Good: Location location ! Easy Check in And our
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast was slim pickings. No cereal or toast. No yoghurt. Only bagels with unrefrigerated cream cheese and quick oats porridge. Don't go for the breakfast. Good: Great room, clean and a comfortable."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Cozy room and vibe to this place... many food options close by.. minutes from Fenway Park and the house of blues
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Complimentary breakfast. Good: Location was great, right where we wanted to see some attractions. Free breakfast was a little misleading, (just say appetizers, and fruit basket). But overall, would definitely recommend, and stay again. Staff was good, and room was quiet."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: Coffee and juice were nice to start out the day with! Cold cereal would have been a plus.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient location in the city centre walkable to most attractions
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast can be better. Its very simple, I had to go out and seek for a real breakfast because the hotel option was not attractive at all. Good: Very good location. Our room was good, you get what you pay, anything more."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: Staff was wonderful! The location perfect. Nice breakfast
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast was a little sparse but was as advertised. Good: Nice room, small but cozy."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: The room we stayed in has a window was facing an alley. We were woken up at 3 am by the garbage truck and they were there until 5.30 AM picking trash from the entire alley, not a good idea for light sleepers. The hotel should invest a bit in better soundproof windows. Good: Good spread of breakfast. Friendly staff Great shower and toiletries"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Nothing to complain about Everything was fine and week with the price. It is very central in Boston and close to the public transportation.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Good: Excellent location
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast a bit simple, but plenty of places to eat in the local area. Also, the safe in our room didn't seem to work, but it wasn't a big deal. Good: Excellent location, with Copley T (metro) station within a few minutes walk, and a range of restaurants and bars along Boylston Street. The Back Bay area also has a few great sights to see, like the old Trinity Church and Boston public library, which are almost within spitting distance of the hotel. If you're here during the Boston Marathon (mid April), the hotel is almost literally on the finishing line, which could be very useful or very inconvenient, depending on whether you're a runner or not!"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Nothing. Good: It's economical, boutique style (my fave), great quality in an A+ location for Boston visitors."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: No hot water in the morning. Poor choice for breakfast - very little that was healthy. Good: Great location, nice room."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: It's not a negative per se but, breakfast could be more widely selective. But what was there was absolutely fantastic. Good: We were super-well accommodated, the staff was super-friendly and helpful. Location is great, and even on a loud street you couldn't here a thing."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Tempeture control. Fan was not automatic. Had to manually turn off and on. not a deal breaker. Good: Location and staff. Staff was very friendly and helpfull. We arrived a few hours before check in and they held our luggage while we explored the area. Lots of shopping an dinner choices close by. T was 2 minutes away. Room was nice.
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Good: continental breakfast was great - and length of time offered was excellent. 24 hour desk personnel was a special plus and very helpful - at any hour. location is excellent - nothing better for shopping, restaurants, public transportation, sightseeing, etc. Close to everything you visit Boston for and great staff plus affordable."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Good: Location, location, location"
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient location in the city centre walkable to most attractions
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: Bed was a bit hard. Breakfast was all carbs, but was better than nothing. Good: Great location, right near two T stops and directly across from the Boston Public Library. Super nice staff. Great bar downstairs. Great price. We loved having music speakers overhead in main room and bathroom. Roomy, hot shower with great water pressure. Free continental breakfast with good coffee."
Boston,The Charlesmark Hotel,"Bad: I think there could be more options offered as breakfast (there were only bagels and donut like something, and fruits), but it was still enough. So it's not something I didn't like but something that can be improved. Good: This hotel was a great one! When we entered room, there was classical music coming from the stereos, which give us a very nice feeling to start with. The bathroom, the towels, the bed, everything was clean, organized. I wish I could stick around more and enjoy the room as I stayed for 2 nights and was in the hotel to sleep only. The room was also facing the Boston public library, which was a blissful view, that makes you feel like you're in full luxury. The surrounding area was great, the parallel street (I believe it was Newburry) is full of nice clothing boutiques. It's really close to variety of food options and also right next to Copley station which makes public transportation a total ease. But I think when the weather permits, it's totally walkable to go around Freedom Trail etc. Also, I arrived very early in the morning and left in the middle of night, both felt okay to be out in the street, which is something I value the most."
Boston,AC Hotel by Marriott Boston Downtown,Bad: Dont change a thing. Good: Staff was very accommodating even those we shared elevator rides with. Location was central and easy to walk places. We enjoyed our stay.
Miami Beach,The Hotel of South Beach,Bad: Pool close too early. Should be stay availble all the time overnight. Good: Room cleanness and staff
Miami Beach,The Hotel of South Beach,"Bad: Couldn't find fault with anything. Good: It might sound strange to say that I was ill in bed for most of my stay but still gave the hotel top ratings!. However, the room was extremely comfortable and clean. The staff were very helpful and pleasant and the location was great. We were in the annex which fronts onto Ocean Drive and there was a very good cafe/bar below. I found out towards the end of the stay they also did room service. Wish I had been well enough to take advantage of this great little hotel."
Miami Beach,The Hotel of South Beach,"Good: The room was lovely and spacious, bed very comfy. Staff changed our bed every day and fresh towels. We could not have been better looked after by manager Lewis. Events organizers Ricardo and John were great help for tours."
Miami Beach,The Hotel of South Beach,"Bad: Expensive of course, wish the hotel restaurant was more reasonably priced because we wanted to go but couldnt justify. Good: Bed was great and the staff was so genuinely kind"
Miami Beach,The Hotel of South Beach,"Bad: Very noisy at night (24h party directly below the rooms in the other building, traffic). We didn't stay in the main building, we weren't informed before. So please check before, otherwise there's not much sleep possible. Good: Next to Ocean Drive, so the beach is over the street. Room was huge and clean. Valet parking was very fast (39/d), staff was friendly. Also the roomservice was fast and delicious."
Miami Beach,The Hotel of South Beach,Bad: 1. Elevator was broken room was on 3rd floor--moved after a time to another wing with working elevator. 2. Pool under repair--sent to another hotel--no available chairs at the pool - so no pool on a 95 day. Wasted 3 hours of the day. 3. Told there was a 30 minute wait to get a car from valet--called at 7:20 AM--valet was not told to get the car until 7:53 AM. Almost missed plane. Good: management staff was very good when they were there
Miami Beach,The Hotel of South Beach,Bad: Can be a little noisy at night but that is the compromise for being at the centre of all the action. Good: If you are looking to be at the centre of all the South Beach madness then this is the perfect hotel. Located right across from the beautiful beach and in the middle of the Art Deco district. Large comfortable rooms that offer full amenities. Good rooftop pool with great snack and drinks bar. Staff very helpful and John the concierge was great.
New York,The Pearl Hotel,"This hotel is in the perfect location! A half block from Broadway Times Square in the Theater District. The lobby is nothing special, as is the streetfront of the hotel. Our room was clean and very nice. We had a King Deluxe. The bed was ok, not bad, but not exceptional. The toiletries in the bathroom were great! I usually don't use them, but I loved them all. The continental breakfast offered a nice array of options, and was well stocked. The coffee was very good. The free wi-fi was a nice bonus.We had a bit of a problem checking in. We arrived at about 11:30am. I had been told the day before, that it was possible that our room could be ready by 10:30 am, although check in was officially at 4pm. Our room was not ready, so we left our bags, with a promise that we'd be texted as soon as our room was ready. We checked back at about 3pm, even tho we had not been texted. Still not ready, they'd text. We came back about seven, still no text, and were finally able to check in. As we checked in, I heard someone asking about a wine and cheese hour. We had missed it! I remarked to my husband, that I would have loved a glass of wine after such a hectic day. The male who checked us in heard me, and asked what kind of wine we liked, and said that he would send some up, on the house! Within minutes, two bottles of wine, on ice and 2 glasses arrived. To be able to relax in our room, with a glass of wine, really made up for our late check in! The whole staff was very nice and I would definitely stay there again."
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"We have just returned from 10 days at the Aqua Ocean Tower Resort in Waikiki Beach, HI. While this hotel would not be your choice if you are looking for luxury, it is extremely clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful that we considered them friends upon our departure. There were 3 of us - we stayed in a room with 2 double beds, and had more than enough room for our stay. The location of this hotel is KEY! It is only 1 block from the beach, as well as most trolley and bus stops. It is within walking distance of the Honolulu Zoo, Aquarium and many of the shopping plazas and restaurants. We never even had the need to rent a car!! They are currently in the process of renovating their rooms. Even when you were in the room during the day, you did NOT hear the renovations being done on the other floors. Renovations on all floors are to be done in June 2007. We had the opportunity to take a look at a couple of the finished rooms. The new rooms are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! You feel more like you are in your bedroom at home than in a hotel. While this was certainly not the most lavish hotel that I have ever stayed in, it was quite possibly among the best hotel experiences that I have ever had. I will definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family for any trips that they plan to Oahu."
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"When you read the information about Lenore, believe it. She is the bright and shining asset to this hotel. The staff are very personable and helpful. The rooms definitely need some upgrading. The location however is wonderful."
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"This well kept secret has excellent and friendly service with reasonably priced rooms. The absence of a restaurant and bar in the hotel is barely noticed as numerous restaurants and bars are only steps from your room. I would put this hotel up against any on the beach with service and cleanliness. The hotel is updating all the rooms, which are slightly dated, to reflect an Asian influence. This includes projection TV and steam shower. I can't wait!"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"The staff was very helpful and friendly! Lenore was awesome! She delivered a bottle of champagne for our anniversary! Our ocean view room was wonderful and we are looking forward to staying again once the renovation is completed!The rooms were clean, but need some upgrading--But we were only in the room to sleep so it really didn't bother us...The mini fridge came in handy as well as the ABC Market a few steps away. Subway, Coldstone, Wolfgang Puck's are two minutes away walking...Sushi place within 5 minutes walking!!! McDonald's Burger King within 3 minutes walking...Check out the Pacific Hotel for some awesome cuisine and a huge aquarium!Thanks for making our 4th of July fun....Hey, everyone, don't forget to pick up the Entertainment Book for Hawaii...We saved a lot on Parasailing, Hiking, Snorkeling, Restaurants, Pearl Harbor, etc...Great two for one offers! I got mine on Ebay!"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"The hotel is very near the sea...I think about 30 seconds on foot!The rooms are comfortable and clean. No luxury but very good value for money, if we consider the wonderful location of this hotel. Moreover, the staff is extremely kind, friendly and willing to help you...I will never forget the housekeeping manager, who was so sweet, and always gave me breakfast (and in abundant helping) after 10.00 am, since I was always late (let's say I enjoyed Honolulu's nightlife...). All in all, the aloha spirit is so evident in this hotel, which I strongly recommend."
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"Our stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel was amazing! I read one review that didn't understand why this hotel had such good ratings. Well, he must be used to spending 200+ per night for a hotel room, or never traveled to Hawaii. Hotels with this location are often 300+ per night. The reviewer mentioned it being in need of a remodel. Well, unfortunately for those of us used to watching how we spend our money, they are remodeling the hotel and the rooms look awesome!!! They look nicer than the Arizona Biltmore and Phoenician Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona if you have been there. (I had only worked there and got the view the rooms, as I could not afford to spend 400+ per night.) So, when the rates are higher, and in line with the majority of the other hotels, that reviewer should be happy because the new rooms are truly gorgeous. People pay for gorgeous. They are the most modern beautiful hotel rooms I have ever seen.We actually felt lucky to get to stay there before the major remodel. The location is so close to the beach and downtown activities. We could walk to all kinds of wonderful things to do and see. Diamond Head was our view out our bathroom window. I would recommend spending the extra 15 or so per night for the ocean view. So, it wasn't fancy, but it was fun and helped us be able to save quite a bit of money. The bed was comfortable, the ocean breeze was to die for, and we couldn't have asked for more in that price range. I also have to recommend a corner room if you get lucky to have a cross-breeze of ocean air.However, what made it the most wonderful stay was the staff. We were treated like family from the moment we arrived. We never felt so cared for in a hotel. The friendly, caring and attentive staff made it a 5 star hotel in our eyes. We cannot wait to go back and see all the friends we made there. If on a budget get in on the older rooms before they are remodeled. If you have the extra money, get an amazing remodeled room, you won't be dissappointed."
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,The hotel staff was great as was the location. The only thing I'd say needs improvement is the actual building and rooms. The rooms seemed a bit old and could use major renovations. But for the price we paid with a last minute booking we were happy with the accomodations.
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"I stayed at the Ocean Tower Hotel for a week in early May based on positive reviews from TripAdvisor. These reviews were completely fair. This was an affordable hotel, located footsteps to Waikiki Beach. The rooms were clean and quiet the staff were friendly and accommodating. True, the hallways have tired carpet and the walls could do with some fresh wallpaper. But who cares about these trifles This was a great hotel. (However, if you are watching your weight, give the continental breakfast -- peanut-and-jelly on toast, danishes and donuts -- a wide berth. Fortunately, the rooms come with mini-fridges so you can store some healthier options which you can purchase at one of the many ubiquitous 'ABC' convenience stores.)"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"The familial Ohana spirit of Hawaii is exuded by the staff of Ocean Tower Hotel in Waikiki. My fiance and I have made 3 trips in total to Honolulu and this by far was the best experience with a hotel there because of the very warm welcome and service provided by the staff at the Ocean Tower Hotel.Leonor in particular (and as mentioned by numerous reviews here) made us feel more 'at home' than at home.Also, as mentioned by previous reviewers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to update and modernize their rooms. The renovations were not felt or noticed by us... there was no noise and construction people noticed during our stay 05/19-05/26. We got a personal glimpse of some of the completed new rooms and what we saw indicated 5 star quality.. tile floors, Asian influenced decor, new furnishings, state of the art TV and projectors, lighting, top of the line bathroom fixtures. Once available (by end of the year we were told), I am selfishly hoping the rates would not be too different as I would love to come back to stay in those new rooms!Everyday after an exhaustive tour or beach excursion during our stay, we were extremely impressed by the clean bedding, clean bathroom and air conditioned room we returned to. Not once did we have a single complaint about the room or hotel facilities. We did at one point need the use of a microwave to heat some food and the hotel staff was happy to allow us the use of theirs."
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"Everything positive you've read about this hotel in the Trip Advisor reviews is spot on. I originally considered the Ocean Tower precisely because TripAdvisor had it rated so highly, and my wife was adamant that we should stay in Waikiki. Normally, getting around Waikiki is painful in a car because of the traffic, but since this hotel sits at the end of the strip, it is really easy to get to from the H1 by taking the King Street Exit. Anyway, the hotel is smaller than many I've stayed in, but that (and the incredible customer service!) gives it a very intimate feel. The rooms are good sized and are seemingly soundproof, which I really appreciated. The hotel is literally a block from the beach. The parking lot is small, but they immediately gave us the option to park around the corner at the large garage of a different hotel and that ended up being a less expensive option as well.The staff was wonderful, in particular Leonore and Terry. They really took great care of us (and I have to say it's nice when the managers call you by name everytime they see you). It was my birthday while we were there, and even though they sent some treats up to the room each day, on my birthday they sent champagne and glasses.We also got to tour the rooms that are being renovated, and I can't wait to go back once that is complete in the November timeframe. The new rooms have an ultra-modern, San Francisco/ Asian theme to them, and have all the amenities one could ask for, especially if you are a technogeek like me.Overall, I was incredibly impressed with the hotel and will stay here anytime I have business or vacation in Honolulu."
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"We just returned from a 6-night stay at the Ocean Tower and we loved it. Great location- less than a block from the beach. We knew it was an older hotel with rooms that needeed some updating, but the rooms were fine. Very clean and with comfortable beds. Our room (906) had a terrific view of the ocean and it had a balcony with a view of Diamond Head. It was probably the best room in the hotel. The hotel staff is great! Very, very nice and helpful. The free breakfast is coffee, juice, and sweet rolls. The coffee was available starting at 6 am and the rest was available 7:30 - 9:30. Breakfast is adequate. Again, the staff are always there to help. We were given some juice at noon as we checked out.This hotel is a great value. It may not be a 4 or 5 star hotel, but it is more than acceptable and a real bargain for the money. The managment has big plans to upgrade the rooms. We were shown two rooms which have just been remodeled and they are awesome (an oriental-type design with plenty of high-end amenities). Look for the remodeling to take 12-18 months to complete. They plan to remodel 2 floors at a time. When the remodel is done, this will be an excellent hotel. As a smaller hotel with only 9 floors, it offers a more intimate atmosphere and there are no long waits for the elevators.We highly recommend this hotel!"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"I really like the trip to Hawaii, and I think that everybody in the hotel was really nice to us in every think, the rooms were really clean, the breakfast were good too, and all the people help me when I had a question. I would come to the same hotel if I'll return to Hawaii. It was a really good experience.Ana"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"Had a really nice stay at hotel renew. Was close to the beach near to where they have a concrete break to stop the waves crashing, so would be good for young families. The bed was really comfy. Only a couple of negatives, the room we were in had a window in the bathroom, and a frosted glass door to the bathroom. This meant light streamed in through the window and door in the morning. Also there wasn't much for breakfast if you are trying to avoid sugar and there wasn't a lot of space.Aloha!!!Mahalo nui loa (thank you very much) for choosing to stay with us and for providing valuable feedback of your experience. Were glad you enjoyed our close proximity to our famous Kuhio Beach, restaurants, shopping outlets, and tourist attractions We are dedicated to touch all we encounter with integrity and the gracious spirit of Aloha as we fulfill the dreams of our guest. Overall we hope you had a positive experience on Oahu, and enjoy all the adventure our island has to offer. If your travels bring you back to Waikiki, we would be delighted to host you again. Mahalo,Thomas Harris Jr. General Manager"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"My husband and I just returned from a five day trip to Waikiki - my first time there, and we were thrilled with our choice to stay at Aqua Ocean Tower Hotel. We would definitely stay there again! As many others have already mentioned, the staff is like none other I've EVER met in a hotel. We felt like family in just a few short days. They even hugged us good-bye when we left!! Every single staff member that we encountered greeted us with a big smile, hello and answered many questions that we had about dining, directions, tips, souvenir ideas, sightseeing, etc. They offered to special order us our favorite donuts to be delivered first thing in the morning when their breakfast pastries were delivered. They set aside our favorite pastries for us while we went shopping so they wouldn't all get eaten up during the continental breakfast. We had a late flight out and they allowed us to check out as late as possible during the day and then still extended us the option to come back later in the day if we got tired to stay in their complimentary room. They showed us one of the completed newly renovated rooms, which is just lovely. It has a modern, asian look and feel to it. Very beautiful! I cannot wait to come back and stay in one of the new rooms! They said the renovations were supposed to be completed this summer, but things have been put on hold for now and they're not sure yet when all the renovations will be done. The walls are a little thin and one night our neighbor had his tv up way too loud all night. At about 3 am we finally called the front desk and they immediately took care of the problem. They went to our floor and discovered that there were actually about four rooms near us that all had loud tvs. They contacted all rooms by phone, except for one, and the security guard took care of the other room. We slept like babies the rest of the time!! Leonor, the manager, made me a beautiful purple lei to take with me as a souvenir from our trip and stay there. If you're unsure about whether or not this would be a good place to stay, I can assure you you'll be glad you stayed there. It's only one block from the beach. It's very clean and there are two Great restuarants at the hotel next door - the Tiki Grill and Wolfgang Puck Express. We ate at both places twice, they were that good and with very reasonable prices, too. Tiki Grill was a bit more expensive with a beautiful ocean view, but we just ordered several appetizers. The coconut shrimp was awesome and they had very good salmon. We had the Asian Noodle Salad at Wolfgang Puck, which also has an ocean view, but they also have great pizzas and sandwiches. For parking, we kept our car at a garage about a block 1/2 away from the hotel for only 8/day instead of 15/day at the hotel. You won't disappointed if you stay here!!!"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"We spent months searching for the perfect place to stay for our 10th anniversary trip to Oahu. After reading several great reviews, we chose Ocean Tower.After having made the reservations on expedia.com, we called the hotel to see if we could reserve a king bed with a balcony. Nothing could be for sure but the nice young man said he would put us down for one.We arrived in Honolulu late, after a long flight. Check in for us was a breeze! In just a minute we had our key cards. We were well pleased with the room. We were able to get the king bed and balcony after all! Upon entering the room, we were greated with a cool clean room. We couldn't have been more pleased with our room. The was even a desk area where we were able to set up our lap top, and a safe, no extra charge.Leonor Wong met us the next morning with a smile and an offer of custard pie and fresh pineapple to share. She was very friendly as we chatted, she asked what we were in Hawaii for. We answered with it being our 10 year anniversary. After some exploring on the island we came back to our room to find champagn chilling in ice with glasses and box of chocolates and a beautiful flowering plant! We were thrilled and touched at the efforts this women and her staff and boss go to for their customers.We did breakfast a few times downstairs in the hotel. It was a nice little set up, with a toaster and bread, peanut butter and jelly. There were also some really delicious muffins and some other types of pasteries. The coffee was wonderful, there was hot tea and also pineapple juice. The lobby area was a great place to sit and sip your coffee and nibble on the yummy muffins.Grace, the front desk girl was very friendly and helpful. I was suprised that as many people they have in and out daily, she remembered my last name and we had not actually met. She was helpful to print out driving directions for us several times and had clean beach towels for us each day when we headed out.The location of the hotel was great.We had an ocean view room even though we didn't pay for one. That was nice.The beach is a 2 minute walk, and the ABC store right next to Ocean Tower. It is within walking distance of many great resturants and shops.Over all, our stay was a wonderful time for us. We had tons of fun all day long and then had a nice cool, clean room to come back to and relax. When it came time for us to check out, Leonor present us with handmade leis she had made for us. We were very touched. Then she handed us a little basket with more chocolates and macadamia nuts! She also sent me away with fresh baked banana bread too! We really felt special. This place is a people friendly place. They treat each guest as though they were the most special. I have never seen this high quality customer service before in my life!If you are looking for a place to stay that is close to the beach, this is it. This is the place to stay no matter what. I do know they are upgrading their rooms and we were able to see 2 of these finished rooms. Wow.This hotel is probably going to go up to a 4 star rating.When we return to Oahu oneday we will be staying with Ocean Tower. These are some special people and they are doing it right!"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"We stayed here because it was 1 on Tripadvisor and we were not disappointed at all! It was such a great location with extremely friendly staff, we stayed an extra week! The manager, Terry, head of housekeeping, Leonor and our housekeeper, Tina were all very helpful with anything we needed / wanted! They were around on a regular basis to interact w/ guests and offer a friendly hello. It is a smaller hotel w/ only 9 floors, so we found it to be extremely quiet. It is located just 1/2 block from the beach so walking back and forth all day long was no big deal. They offer free towels and beach mats at the front desk as well! Would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GREAT value! We can't wait to get back! MM from CT"
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"My wife and I had a very nice time in Waikiki. We wanted to have a good time and not spend too much money. We booked a standard room at the Ocean Tower Hotel. Renovations are going on now to upgrade all the rooms. Our first room was clean and met our needs. But one night we had a small problem with a sprinkler in our room. To take care of the problem we were given a deluxe ocean view room for the same price. This made the vacation so much nicer, getting up in the morning and looking at the ocean. I have Leonor Wong to thank for this and many other things she did to make are stay so nice. When we go back to Waikiki we will stay at the Ocean Tower Hotel."
Honolulu,Hotel Renew,"Stayed here for a week and had a fantastic experience. After reading other great reviews, decided that combined with price, this sounded like a great place to stay. Was not disappointed. Location was great -- less than 1 block to Waikiki Beach. Only 1 block other direction to bus stops, Kuhio Ave. Was able to walk from hotel to any Waikiki attraction in very short distance. I was glad I upgraded to the ocean view room because the view was great. Leonor was a wonderful host, providing us with bamboo mats, rafts, and beach towels free of charge, and boxes of candy on departure. This hotel will very shortly have a new name, though, as it is being remodeled. The rooms now are old, but clean. The new rooms that Leonor showed us are unbelievable with modern amenities. The first of the new rooms are set to open in a few wks. Can't imagine what this will do to the price but with the location and helpful staff, it just might be worth it.Would recommend staying here to anyone looking for a hotel low on price and great on hospitality!"
New York,Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown,"I was pleasantly surprised by my visit. After arriving in NYC, I noticed that I booked the wrong Four Seasons. It was my intention to stay at the Four Seasons close to Central Park. However, the services at the Four Season Downtown location exceeded my expectations. They were able to provide check-in for an early arrival (11:00 am) to a spacious, clean beautiful room. The breakfast provided through room-service was delicious (you must try the truffle scramble eggs). My dinner at the Cut was outstanding. This is an exceptional addition to the Financial Area."
New York,The James New York ‚Äì NoMad,"I have stayed at the hotel several times over many years (while it was The Carlton). I am SO Very excited about this hotel for so many reasons. While I know there has been some challenges with renovations, I wish people would not get hung...More"
New Orleans,MOXY New Orleans Downtown/French Quarter Area,"I am currently in house and felt in necessary to write a review immediately. This hotel is amazing and I would recommend it to any and everyone staying in NOLA. The entire staff is fantastic and friendly. Even prior to arrival, their service was seamless. I had to send a credit card authorization because my wallet was stolen and it was handled by the staff in no time at all. I even mentioned that I was arriving super early in the morning and I arrived at 9am to find my room was already checked in and waiting for me, which was so beyond my request. It is hip, trendy, fun, lively and worth every dollar. The room, while on a low floor, is perfect. I had a problem with my television, which I normally need to sleep and even though it was late and the staff could not immediately rectify the issue, it was the way it was handled that truly made all the difference. I could not be more pleased. I will say one thing.. a word to the wise, if you will. Bourbon Street will get you every time. I was somehow hungover by 6pm. Drink Responsibly."
New Orleans,Bienville House,"It was our first visit to NOLA and first stay at Bienville House but it will not be our last! From check in to check out we were treated courteously, even at the restaurant/bar where we had fun drinking fun drinks. Our room was beautiful...so NOLA and the marble bathroom and shower was perfect...LOVE Bienville House!!!"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: nothing. Good: Location is perfect. Near to the beach, resturants, lounge bar, etc. the room is good and clean."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: The mini bars are basic. I mean... if that's the only thing I can think of ...then this place is amazing. Good: Everything was perfect. Friendly staff, wonderful location, and they even had a whole setup with lounges on the beach that I was unaware of that was just perfect, too."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: a pool would be a plus.the bathroom was too little. Good: the room was comfortable and excellent location. Good value for the money
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Poor sound isolation in rooms. Good: Close to most attractions
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: I didnt like being charged daily fees for the beach/pool when I never used them. Good: I was incorrectly being charged for the previous guests breakfast, its a good thing I checked my bill. I liked that the complaint was immediately checked and the bill promptly rectified."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Good: From the room, to the staff to the location.....this hotel has it all... and who doesnt like breakfast that is served until noon....i was a little worried at first, because i couldnt believe the deal we got for a hotel in SoBe....but everything was just PERFECT...."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Good: The staff was fantastic and amazingly helpful.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Was a bit pricey, but may be that was the season and the timing (March 17, it was a music festival at Miami Beach). Good: Very clean and stylish. Very helpful staff."

Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Good: Best Location SouthBeach, nice staff!"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Good: Great location on Ocean Drive. Room and amenities were nice and comfortable. Nice lounge, bar area. Very nice and helpful staff. Bathroom a bit tight but fine."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Construction next door. Good: Big front porch, short walk to beach"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Good: Very friendly staff. Rental of a beach chair and umbrella was included in the room price.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Only down side was the breakfast as hot choices were always overcooked splitting hairs as a coffee drinker would say coffee was awful. But you have perfectly good diner 2 block away so no big deal. Good: Location, rooms, front Terrace and great staff plus the hotel was super clean and well presented. Will definitely be back. Not forgetting beach towels provided and sun loungers on the beach."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Nothing!. Good: The hotel staff were very nice. The location of the Hotel is perfect. Its right at the beach and you even get a couple chairs and an umbrella.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Good: Staff and service was very friendly and helpfull. Hotel is nice, location is nice."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: The bedsheeet was not really clean when we checked in. Good: Nice location, and I loved the bed so much it was so comfortable. The receptionists were really helpful and friendly."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Good: The breakfast was fantastic as we partying late in Miami Beach and we were able to have our brekkie up until 12 noon! Also, the staff were all very friendly!"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Little storage space in the room small bath. But I knew that when we booked the room from other reviews, so it was as expected especially in boutique hotel. No complaints. Good: Nicely decorated boutique hotel just a couple of blocks south of the crazy South Beach scene. Several upscale restaurants a short walk away down the quiet side of South Beach. Enjoyed complimentary breakfast on the porch. Comfortable bed with nice pillows."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Small rooms for American standards. Could have been cleaner. Towels were dirty. Average standard hotel, not as good as expected. Good: Very good location, one block from the beach (2 min walk). 3 min to Ocean Drive/Lummus Park, 5 min to Nikki Beach Club. Chairs and umbrellas on the beach from an external provider from 8.30 am to 6.30 pm included. Towels are provided. Valet parking 35 for 24h, no overnight street parking (day 4/h)."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: The bathroom toilet area is tight. Would not probably be comfortable for larger person. You can hear through walls bit isn't much of an issue as probably will not be in room most of time. Good: Great location to beach and bars/restaurants. Convenient beach service as related to provided towel, chair, and umbrella service. Very good happy hour prices as related to that areas prices."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: The valet parking was the worst at one time waited 45 min then 30 min for my vehicle to arrive. Twice the excuse given was the ticket inside vehicle was wrong.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: THE BATHROOM WAS ON THE SMALL SIDE...PROBLEMS CONTINUALLY WITH THE TV / CABLE RECEPTION...HAD TO CHANGE ROOMS ON MY 3RD NIGHT BECAAUSE THE AC WENT OUT...VERY ANNOYED ABOUT THAT..BUT...OH WELL...
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Good: Location is just excellent! And the fact that they provide you included sunbed at the beach!
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: There was loud music playing at night and in the morning. Luckily I'm a heavy sleeper so it didn't really bother me. Good: Great location in Miami Beach (south). Close to all the action but off the main stretch so it's more peaceful. Near to lots of shops. There was an issue with our room and we had to spend one night in their sister hotel. The staff couldn't have been more helpful to make sure we were comfortable. The hotel offers a portable wifi hotspot for guests to take out with them - very cool!
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Its not something i didn't like, its more like a recommendation since its not something quite important, and actually i don't know if other rooms have it but particularly my room didn't have a big mirror other than the one in the bathroom. Also, i think breakfast can be maybe until 11:30am, like other restaurants or hotel provide, more like a brunch style and serve more options. Good: Really modern hotel, very very clean room almost like if we were the first to use it, excellent staff. We arrived at 10am approximately since our flight was early in the morning and they managed to give us an available room. hotel is at an excellent location since its ocean drive but not at the crowded noisy part so we could party, and still be able to rest and sleep well!"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Uncomfortable beds. Good: Location
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: the only thing i found not 100 great was the low water pressure in the shower. Good: i love everything about the hotel really. it's just 2 blocks off the beaten track in a very quiet, ye central area of south beach. came during art basel so prices were of course high, but still reasonable"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Bathroom a bit small. Good: Good hotel. Close to beach and bars and restaurants. Good staff
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Nothing. Good: Convenient to airport, great staff, lovely decor."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: The bathroom was extremely tiny although had a good sized shower. Good: The location was excellent being a short stroll to a beautiful beach, near the historic art deco buildings and many good restaurants. The bedroom was large with a very comfortable bed. Interesting , different artwork throughout the hotel. Good variety of food at breakfast"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: room 222 is directly below the fitness center and it gets very loud when someone is on the treadmill. Good: Devon at the front desk was a phenomenal host! He went above and beyond to make our stay great!
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Air conditioning wasn't working when we arrived, but the maintenance person fixed it. Good: Location friendly staff."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: paying extra for Valet Parking. Good: The Kings room
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: You can hear everything we could even hear folks snoring in the next room!!!!!. Good: Location

Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Expensive but all of south beach is. . Good: Location
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Good: The serviceminded staff in the reception (specially Maria)
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Small rooms Poor and overprized breakfast. Good: Great location
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: As others have commented the Valet Parking at 35 per day is steep however it is known before you sign up to it, there is a parking lot close by that only charges 15 per day although not sure what they would charge if you wanted to leave overnight. Good: Very good location on Ocean Drive but away from the noise of the main area. Breakfast was ideal, plenty of choice and had the added bonus available until noon Rooms were clean and tidy and we did not find them small and we had two large suitcases in each as well as other hand luggage. Staff always acknowledged you"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: The house is built in another age - access to rooms and room size are not large - but OK. The rooms are not well insulated reg. noise. The other guests behaved very nicely - good clientele - but when the garbage truck etc. is working out back, you will know it! Bring your earplugs and you'll be fine. Good: Staff was very helpful, courteous and professionel in a good way. Front desk staff responded quickly to my requests (WiFi code renewal, instruction in how to make calls from phone in room, air-con etc). I ran into the sales manager as well - I think the new owners are putting a pretty good team together, who all know that customer satisfaction is king!"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Delays in checkin, no liquor license yet!. Good: Location room"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: very small room and bathroom, noisy AC. Good: excellent staff and service, very friendly and accommodating, good location on Ocean Drive"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Good: Location. Peace and quiet. Breakfast good, nice bar."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Hotel tried to charge extra for change in tax. Had a difficult time during check in because of this factor. Room was very small for three people to stay in. Good: Hotel was clean and close to everything in south beach.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: The room is very small. The footstep sound from other room can be heard. The wifi is too weak. Good: What I really like is the location and decorations. It only takes 5 minutes to beach.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: I stayed at this hotel for 2 days..they asked me to pay 100 deposit even though I did not know that I had to spit this money before booking the room I finally agreed and in good faith and i paid I was told that the money will be returned back to my account within 7 working daysand so it was done for 1 month and the money I did not get back.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: quite a bit of noise from the upstairs 'neighbors.' They could do better with soundproofing... also, the breakfast was a bit weak. Eggs overcooked, somewhat tasteless and kind of cold, no specialty coffee drinks available and not much for healthy options. if you have a car, beware that for all intents and purposes the valet parking is required, and will run an extra 35/night. Good: lovely decor, super friendly and helpful bilingual staff. Bed was comfortable and the shower was good."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: service and staffs are not fully trained and don t smile. Good: location
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: The facility is normal and so many people held parties at night, so you may not wanna stay there if you are seeking a place where is relaxing and quiet. Good: Staffs are friendly and the location is good"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Good: Ideal location for South Beach.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Invoicing of non used items after leaving the hotel.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: The small breakfast was offered at an additional cost. It had limited items for a vegetarian diet. Good: I was impressed with the complementary robes and slippers and not to mention the decor is as beautiful in person as it is online!
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: The staff never changed the sheets and I was there 4 nights. No microwave or refrig. Good: I like it was a min from the beach
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Good: I really liked the water in the lobby.
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: Bed bugs. Room too small. Too expensive When I was going to sleep, I found some bed bugs in my bed. It's terrible! I went to lobby to find someone help me. The receptionist helped me change a room. This room is even smaller than the previous one. I can't sleep all the night because it's too noisy, and I am still afraid of the bugs. The next day, I told the receptionist I would like to check out, even I booked for 3 night. She agreed, but didn't give me any compensation. I paid 300+ for a room which had bugs and was noisy, small. Good: The attitude of staff."
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: There was nothing I didn't like! It was the best!. Good: EVERYTHING! The staff was amazing and friendly, very courteous, always made sure you were ok and comfortable. They gave suggestions on things to do and places to go...simply amazing! The hotel smelled amazing, it's the first thing you notice walking in! It's very clean and nice. You get beach towels, a chair and umbrella. The beach is literally a block away, and you're also located a block from all of the action of South Beach. The hotel is located in a quieter area, so it's great to wind down after a long day. This hotel was one of the highlights of our trip! We will always stay here for our trips to Miami, I'm so happy we chose this hotel!"
Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: Room size. Good: Location

Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,Bad: everything ok. Good: all good

Miami Beach,Room Mate Lord Balfour,"Bad: There was nothing I did not like. Good: Art Deco, location, price, and bed...."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Was told I would get a robe and didn't.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Spa wasn't available. Good: Staff are exceptional and very friendly
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Car was freshly washed before we arrived to valet the car. 3 days later, the car was filled with hard water marks from the sprinklers and now we need to get the car detailed to remove the spots. A bit frustrating to not get the car back in the same condition... Good: Location great, staff was pleasant, buffet was good and the chef that made the omelet was amazing"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: I didn't like that check-in 'begins' at 4pm. You check in and wait for them to call you when your room is ready. Ours was ready at 6p. This was more of a plain hotel, not like a 'Vegas' hotel. Food, entertainment, and 'gambling' were limited. This is the best spot to be AWAY from Vegas while IN Vegas...if that's what you're looking for. Good: All amenities were top of the line."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Nothing!. Good: 1.Great location, although 1 block back from the strip it is very central and perhaps better than staying on the strip to the far left or right. 2. Value for money for the size and comfort of the room 3. Short walk from hotel room to lobby entry unlike most mega hotels in Vegas 4. Small bar/casino across the road with 1 beer... unheard of on the strip"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: I booked a room with city view but they said the only view is of the wheel. Good: The staff were helpful, comfortable beds and location."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: I was overcharged at the property and after two requests to front desks no one got back to me. The third time I went to follow up myself. They overcharged me 130 dollars for the room. The hotel was under renovation so it was not good being on a partial construction site with the sound of drills going off. I would advise to shop around on the strip. Good: Bed was comfortable
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Pre-paid for a premium room with two double beds but was given a disability access room with a king bed. .
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: View from room over car park. Good: Great location just off the main strip near Caesars Palace. Room comfortable and staff helpful. Allowed us to have a late check out at no extra cost.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The first room - AC not working. No hot water in bathroom. The second room - was not totally cleaned. Leftover shampoo, conditioner, and soap were found in tub area. AC is noisy."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: Structure, room"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: Excellent location, clean interior, very good staff. Easy check in/out. Free parking where the nearby hotels charge for parking even if you stay there."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: Didnt smell like smoke, and no gambling"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: They cannot find my booking ticket when I arrived, and the girl who serve us went to have joke with others, let us wait for her for a long time. Mini bar is empty."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: No pool. The Breakfast room was not appealing. The buffet was limited. Good: The heavenly beds
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The elevator was tricky to use as you had to insert your room key which didn't always work. The front desk never mentioned it either so I had to figure it out on my own. Good: The location was great. The room was basic but still nice and clean. The pool was low key, perfect for relaxing."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Restaurant was bad. Good: Thank God for the Starbucks
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: More restaurants. Good: Very friendly staff.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: No my experience was horrible it was a bad experience frome the moment we arrived to the moment we left. I had 6 rooms reserved 2 were canceled by hotel then when we asked questions the manager decides to to rais his voice at us to the point everyone on line to check in and around tje aria was able to here what was going on. My guest were unhappy they traveled from sacramento to vegas a 9 hour drive to vet bad service. Then vale was horrible my sisters car was broken into while on possession of vale instead of helping they yelled at her and dint help her. Ontop of that all my guest and I were separated and it was hard to meet up in my room they elevaters only alow access to your floor not others. Good: .

Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Great stay for short stay.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: At breakfast the waiter gave you a receipt stating that although the breakfast was free (included in the price of B B) it was worth 49.98, ie they were after a tip. I felt this was unnecessary and made guests feel uncomfortable. The breakfast was self service, the waiters just brought tea and coffee. Good: This hotel was lovely, very clean, good breakfast and friendly staff. Good situation,about 5 minutes walk to The Strip."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The toilet in our room blocked couple times. Good: Great location and free parking! Less than 5 mins walk to the strip.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The phone receiver didn't work. And the room wouldn't get as cold as I like. Good: I love my stay at the Westin.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Friendly staff. Every thing was perfect.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: I loved everything
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: I can't think of anything. Good: The hotel was less than 1/2 mile to the strip (an easy 10 minute walk), which allowed me to be close enough to take advantage of it, but far enough removed to get away from the mega-ness of it. Check-in was easy, the staff was friendly and helpful, the size of the room was pretty standard (which is all I wanted or needed), the bathroom was clean and well-appointed, and the bed was comfortable."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Check-in process as staff was deceptive and misleading as to when we could check-in. Others around us were equally upset with the dishonesty. Good: Great price through Booking.com. Room was clean and bed comfortable.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: I was mistakenly booked the wrong date to extend my stay using Booking.com. However, the receptionist, Ms. Lynn, very helpful by giving a call to Booking.com and finally be able to change the date."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Difficult to reach reservation staff (no tollfree number, nobody answering phone during business hours, long waits on hold), inflexibility in changing a reservation a week in advance, not enough towels, toilet too low and tub too high. A bit pricey... Good: Location, quality of free toiletries"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Our toilet overflowed at 1am and the water wouldn't stop. When we tried to call reception the phone didn't work. My husband went down to reception whilst I packed our clothes as I naturally assumed we would be given another room. He returned with a maintenance employee and a housekeeping employee. They refused to give us another room (so we could go back to sleep!) instead keeping us awake until 2am whilst they sorted out the problem, extracted the water from the floor (the bathroom was flooded), mopped the floor and brought fresh towels. Good: The reception staff were very friendly. A bottle of sparkling was sent to our room to celebrate our wedding anniversary upon our arrival. That was a really nice touch."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: The bed was like sleeping on a cloud! The location is away from the congestion of the strip but easily accessible. The Westin will be my first and only option when staying in Vegas.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Toothpaste. I wish more hotels came with toothpaste in the bathroom . I hate calling to get some. It's a necessity. That's my only complaint, but that's pretty much for every hotel I've stayed in. Good: The bed was beyond comfortable, didn't want to get up at all"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: quiet off the strip but close enough to walk. Good: beds were very comfortable
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Nothing. Good: Quieter compared to the strip hotels
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Hotel was under a major renovation n there is no casino n no restaurants within the hotel. Ice machine was broken on our floor. You have to have key access to get ice from other floors but no access ever given. We had to ask 6 times for keys! They wouldn't work at all! Very very inconvenient! Apparently from what the staff said they have key problems all the time n i saw lots of guest going through the same problems. Staff is also rude in a professional way. Good: Beds we're comfy
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: 25 resort fee when we did not use the facilities. Good: Clean,comfortable, location and clean"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Buffet Break fast was not to the standard of Westin. Small casino Worst of all away from Strip, which was not described well by booking.com when booking hotel......... Only one small restaurant. Good: Staff was very courteous."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: I'd go again. So relaxing. Aside from BALLEYS, it was a longer than desired walk to other attractions."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Was a little too far to walk to the strip. Good: Bartender was awesome got complimentary drinks at bar. Very clean.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Room decor a little outdated. Air conditioner too loud. Walls a little thin so neighbors can sometimes be heard. Good: Value relative to other hotels. Location was convenient for exploring the strip.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: No casino.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: .. Good: Five minute walk to The Strip - Belligio. Monorail station across the street at Bally's. Car hire agency in hotel.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Vacant block and vagrancy around hotel. Good: Proximity to the strip, yet quiet and friendly"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The staff were not professional. The reception staff who helped me checking in was dressed like being at home. She looked very tired and communicated with me without any expression on her face. My bathroom was a disaster. It became a swimming pool after I used it each time. BTW, the real swimming pool was closed for the seasonal reason. Good: The staff were helpful. The bed is comfortable. The location is just in the very center of the main tourism avenue."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Had to wait in line for 45 minutes to check in not enough staff to help. Room was not ready for an hour after check in.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Staff was rude to me and didn't recognize my platinum status
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: nil. Good: Good place if you don't want to be directly on the strip. Large rooms, clean and renovate, which is not always the case in Las Vegas. Perfect breakfast and very gooid service."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Hidden fees for amenities.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: The staff were courteous and our view from our room was stunning. Highly recommend

Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Right off strip with all extras included in room price
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Neighborhood. Good: Comfortable, great service."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The pool area was really disappointing. Very small and the service wasn't great. The bathroom in the room needed an upgrade. Needed a re-grouting in the shower, the sink had a huge crack in it and the sink made this weird gurgling noise when anyone above or below us turned on a tap. Good: The bed was comfortable."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Food, buffet was good but limited variety. Good: Convenient location and free parking"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Nice breakfast with 5 bottomless mimosas. Very nice and helpful staff. Loved the option to forego room service and get a 5 voucher for use at the hotel. Bed and bedding was very comfortable. The ice cold cucumber and berry water in the lobby was always a welcome sight after returning to the hotel.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Non smoking hotel but people were smoking in casino and staff didn't talk to them. Good: Loved the bed linens...very comfy.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: It was located just off the strip and easy access to everything can't go wrong!!!
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: i love the 24 hour starbucks, pool, and gym so clean and comfy! free valet!"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: The staff was incredibly accommodating! The pool was open 24 hours which was perfect for a late night dip after walking the strip! The view was gorgeous, and conveniently located near the strip."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: 1. You have to walk through the casino to the rooms-- This is irritating. 2. Water took soooo long to get to the 15th floor. Waste of water to run it 7minutes to get it hot. 3. Very costly..... Especially for it's location and to the convention center. Simply outrageous for the value. Good: 1. Staff was great. 2. Room was clean 3. Decor was lovely. 4. Food was great.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Ice maker broke on our floor. Water in lobby not always kept filled. Wasn't always cups available for water. Good: Water in lobby.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The eatery was very expensive, not many choices, it was freezing cold in the hallways, it was noisy, the toilet leaked, and when it wasn't leaking it was running. Called for maintenance but no one came. Tub was dirty. Not impressed at all."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Kept hearing a dog crying in the night when I tried to sleep. Good: Room was accommodated well Staff was friendly and the manager I spoke with whom helped us was very helpful n patient
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Walls are very thin, be prepared to hear your neighbors."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The continental breakfast options vould have had more choices. Along with some breakfast items being available for the 11pm -6am.

Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: I was in Westin Hotel in New York for thanksgiving, It was my worst experience in staying in a hotel ever.But Westin in Vegas was pretty good ."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Facilities feel outdated. Good: Breakfast was great and the Starbucks in the lobby was awesome!
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The restaurant was closed for the day when we arrived so we had to go out yo eat and the free happy hour that I'd read about had been discontinued. That was particularly disappointing as that was one of the factors I looked at when choosing a hotel. Also, the view we had was the parking lot, not the city view I expected. Good: The bed was very comfortable, what I'd expect from a Westin."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Although this hotel was a pet friendly hotel, guests are not allowed to leave their pets in the room unattended. If I needed to step out quickly, I would have to make other arragements for my pet. I seek out hotels that are strictly pet friendly because I know that a little barking isnt going to be an issue. Good: Cleanliness of the hotel, the polite and helpful staff."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The actual pricing of the hotel was different from when i booked it . Good: The starbucks and how there was a gym and pool .

Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: No casino. Good: All of it
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Smoky lobby due to casino - it should be separate from the lobby area Restaurant is noisy and smoky. Good: Room was clean Shower was good, lots of hot water Hotel is close to the strip, makes it easy to walk there"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Our room wasn't ready when we arrived at 4.30 (advised it would be ready from 4). They didn't have a two queen bed room as booked so we had to take a king and a roll in bed as there were 4 of us. Good: Good location and a good price
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Hotel is old, need refurbishment. Good: Value for money"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Hotel facilities starting to look dated. Good: Was priced well for the days we booked (including weekend). Staff was welcoming.

Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The food is too simple. Good: Very quite
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: Delightfully smoke free! No casino, so much quieter than regular Las Vegas hotels. Just behind The Flamingo, so short walk to monorail, Paris or the strip. The concierge, Spencer, was very helpful in getting back to the motel quickly after our show."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Only a block off the strip. Luxurious feeling room. Excellent value!
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Pool is small and quite crowded but it was hot an many people were trying to cool down and relax. Good: The bed was very comfortable, a extra touch with slippers and a bathrobe in the room"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: I will write in English so the staff can read if they wish: we arrived exactly at 4 PM (declared check in time), the room was not ready, the reason being 20 people having done an early check in, please notice that check out time is 11 AM (so they clearly have a workforce planning problem)! An extremely unfriendly staff representative told us that we had to wait, asked me to give her my phone number so that I can receive a text message when the room would be ready, meanwhile we were granted a pass for the pool (which was no extra given that the pool was available for all hotel guests as we were). I asked according to your experience, how long will it take 20 minutes, 1 hour, 3 hours her answer was rude and dismissive I don't know, the only thing I can tell you is to wait for the text message. At that time your room will be available!. So we went to the pool (definitely small and overcrowded), no seats available, very noisy. We waited, and waited and waited and waited... 2 hours and 20 minutes, then I went back to the lobby extremely upset, I started complaining and magically the room was ready... By the way: the text message never arrived. Good: Free parking (is this something to be appreciated)"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Excellent breakfast
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Nothing thought it was very good. Good: Found the location very convenient. Liked the ease of parking. Room very comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. Had one problem - staff took care of it without hesitation.

Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Central location. Nice cafe and a Starbucks on the premises. Easy check in. Very helpful concierge.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The restaurant was less the expected. Food was cold and cleanliness thought-out the restaurant wasn't appetizing. For the prices and advertising it didn't come close. Good: Sean at the check-in was very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Hotel is in the perfect location without the price. Clean and quiet.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The pool was to small. Good: The spa was amazing
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Problems with door lock led to no response from maintenance and even after security got us in, they failed to fix the lock (had to be recoded) despite assuring us they fixed it. So we got locked out again the next morning. Cost us 2 frustrating hours. Good: Location is good for business, quiet but close to everything."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: No bank ATM's...scandalous...not fair. Good: I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE WESTIN. This one didn't disappoint either. Location was great, staff was great and facilities were excellent and clean! The view want bad either."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The hotel is very outdated. Old rooms (we were moved because of an old airco that made a lot of noise), old elevators, tiny beds that should not be sold as double unless you like sleeping on top of each other, mediocre breakfast with very little healthy options (mind you, a 7 extra charge for a cappuccino is outrageous). Very basic pool area. All in all we would give this hotel a good 3 stars. Not more. Good: Location is ok."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Top of the line..great
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Young girl on front desk was very abrupt. Good: For us the location was great,a nice 10 min walk to the strip. Nice clean rooms. Nice pool and hot tub."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Not a fan of cigarette smoke. But I guess you can't do anything about it in the gambling area. Silly to charge a resort fee on top of the room charge. Just charge what you need for the room. Good: Very helpful and friendly staff from check in to the valets.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Gym was closed. Only notification on website was the spa closure. Good: Great + accommodating staff
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The only issue I had was there not being a microwave/refrigerator in the room. Good: Room was clean. It wasn't as crowded as the other well known hotel casinos. The staff was friendly and helpful.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Westin has always the most comfortable beds
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: I loved the fact that staff was very understandable and after a very tough night (shooting and evacuation of the whole Strip) let us stay complimentary till 4pm. This was really exceptional service and hospitality. Thank you!
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The coffee for the in room coffee maker was awful....couldn't drink it. Sooooo bitter and strong !. Good: The bed was extra comfy. View from the room great (overlooked the High Roller) and the room was very clean and housekeeping great.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Expensive breakfast. Good: Clean room, comfortable bed, good location (near but not in the Strip) and calm"

Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The smell sometimes from sewer only when in hallway. Good: The hotel was great and staff was very friendly. We will definitely stay there again
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: There is no longer a casino on the hotel grounds which is unfortunate. Also, the pool is a bit small. You have to battle to find a spot with the lounge chairs at times. Good: The rooms were clean and staff was nice. The parking is free and it is about 1 1/2 blocks from the strip. It is on the north side of the Bally's."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Even though we asked to have the room cleaned they only folded the towels..had to ask for clean cups and coffee!. Good: No smoking hotel...love the beds!
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The lobby is not adequate. You have both Check in and ways out at the same place. Good: Very good value for money and location
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The restaurant was less the expected. Food was cold and cleanliness thought-out the restaurant wasn't appetizing. For the prices and advertising it didn't come close. Good: Sean at the check-in was very friendly as well as the rest of the staff. Hotel is in the perfect location without the price. Clean and quiet.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: check-in line was slow. Good: Parking was very convenient, partly because we drove a hybrid and they had special spaces reserved for hybrids."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: No customer service and they try to bill you for everything, for everything. Good: I wish customer service would reply to my emails. I should be getting a refund, but Booking has never replied to my emails. I guess this was my first time and last time using Booking.com. Worst stay ever."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Little Pricey. Good: Large Room
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: No hot water in the morning. Good: This was a great hotel on the strip. The only downside was bo hot water in the morning. But they acknowledged they had an issue. Would be nice if they could offer a partial refund for this.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The coffee at breakfast was too watery. Good: Beds were super comfortable!!
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Staff are rude. Check in was a little messy. . Good: Comfortable! Good location. Free parking. Breakfast was okay.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Overbooked, could not get additional night. Good: Nice accomodations."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Service was not all it could be especially on check in. Good: Clean, comfortable and easy to walk to the sights."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Nothing. Good: Extremely friendly staff. They help you in every difficulty. You can depend on them.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Had wifi problems for the first 4 nights. The resort fee is a bit of a scam. Good: Very comfortable bed, good sized room, well appointed gym and free parking."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Fit and finish construction of rooms could have been better. Good: n/a
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: I was under the impression there was a casino... there is no casino.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Comfortable Bed !
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: It was perfect, period!. Good: What's there not to like The wonderful staff at the Westin even guessed we were getting married in Vegas and, to our total surprise, when we got back to the hotel after our wedding ceremony, we had a bottle of champagne and chocolate-coated strawberries waiting for us. The hotel's restaurant, the Savona Bistro, simply has the best angus burger in the world! The location, for those of us who prefer to skip the hustle and bustle of the Strip: perfect!"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The referbishment work started before 9am each morning and seemed to be right above our room, whixh meant we didn't get much sleep at all. Good: The location was great and the staff were fantastic. Special thanks to Darwin for our engagement gift which made our stay all the more enjoyable. I would stay here again!"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: This hotel it's the most amazing I have ever stay everything of this hotel it's just awesome
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: rooms were in need of updating especially the bathrooms. Toilet was leaky and loud, the TV was dated, and there were updates being performed at the time of stay. Other than than it was worth the money. Good: The proximity was great because it was easy to access and close enough to the strip. They have a great sandwich shop at the shell station on the corner open until 2 am which is a bonus and saved us a ton of on food. Also a little hole in the wall casino bar where you can get a beer and all beef hot dog for 3, shots for 4 just down the street."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: We parked our car in the hotel parking and the second day we realized that somebody had broken in. Somehow we didn't find Las Vegas a safe place to travel. Solely for leisure, I will not return to US again. Not value for money. Good: It was one of the cheapest places we found in Las Vegas during those days."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: no breakfast incl. Good: close to action but off the strip, so quiet"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: We were not entirely satisfied with the buffet breakfast at the restaurant. The Westin should maybe think about adding a ommlett station, and a waffle station. Good: Rooms are great! Amenities are great! Location 1 block off the strip is great as you can escape from the hustle and bustle for a break to relax. Having 24hr access to pool and hot tub was also great! As relaxing and winding down in the hot tub at the end of your night or day is a real treat!"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Room was a little tight. Good: Comfortable beds: adequate bathing supplies
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: The fact that the Casino was being renovated and not in use, and that we weren't notified about this prior to arrival. An extra tax being applied to our charges. To call this establishment a resort is simply untrue. No laundry facilities available. No exhaust fan in bathroom. A limit as to how cool the air-con could be set. Good: The size and set-up of our room was very good. The location in regards to the stripwas approx 500 metres away."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: The hotel was great I loved the room the bed was super clean and comfortable and so was the bathroom. We only stayed one night here because our other hotel was booked for the rest of the trip but I will definitely be staying here the next time I come to Vegas for my entire trip. Great location
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Customer service and overall quality of hotel was excellent
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: The bed was extremely comfortable, and the staff were friendly. Especially, one that sent us free champagne and strawberries dipped in chocolate to our room. It was our honeymoon so it was sweet of him to do that little act of kindness. The outdoor pool was romantic! I love how it's open 24 hrs! we went for a night swim and saw the lights from the High Roller."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: Nice room, friendly staff"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: There is spa in the name of the hotel and the spa service wasn't available! What a rip-off!. Good: The room was nice with a good view
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: The receptionist Sean was excellent and informative. Housekeeping are good.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Good: Bed was awesome
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Check in at Reception was slow. Good: The hotel was near the strip - walking distance. The room was comfortable, clean, spacious and a nice temparature The housekeeping staff were very helpful and friendly and provided us with extra coffee and water."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: the carpet is damm dirty. Good: It feels like hotel not like any other hotel in Vegas
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: Nothing (little far from strip). Good: Kind people, clean space and cheap price"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: The Breakfast was not complimentary and was expensive .
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: No microwave in room. Good: Bed extremely comfortable professional staff, extra clean. Great place. Also liked the 24-hour Starbucks."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Good: Great location, quiet rooms, wonderful staff. Was a real pleasure to stay there."
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,"Bad: There is no longer a casino, and the pool is seasonal despite it easily being warm enough to be used. The sauna was also out of action. With the lack of these attractions it becomes a very plain hotel. Good: Staff throughout the hotel are excellent, especially at the bar on the late night shift and on reception. Very friendly people. Hotel well presented, clean and comfortable. Location is great, a short walk to bellagio, Paris etc for those who want to be near the strip but not on it all the time!"
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: I liked everything besides the price. Good: The cleanliness
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Advertising there is a casino but their isn't this should be updated so that customers are aware prior to booking. Also our room had an old moldy non working refrigerator. Good: Staff was nice
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Rude Staff.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: I had to be switched because these people next door were partying all hours of the night. At 3am they decided to start arguing in the hall. I called security once for them to turn up their music right after they left. Then security came up again while they were in the hall screaming. I will say this the hotel made it right. They gave me that night free and switched me rooms. Good: The rooms were beautiful. Comfy beds good breakfast.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Nice hotel in LV close to everything. Good: Everyyhing
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Shuttle services to the strip because older people may have problems with feet problems which I do. Good: Everything
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: I expected to have a much larger room that looks more like a suite.
Las Vegas,The Westin Las Vegas Hotel & Spa,Bad: Wasn't on the strip. Good: Showers and location
New York,The Broome,"The Broome doesnt feel like NYC at allIt captures the elegance of Morocco and you feel a world away from the traffic and bustle of the city. The rooms are small, which is standard in NYC, but I did expect a bit more space for the price. The beds are comfy with super luxury sheets. This might be an odd point, but many of the luxury hotels I have been in lately have moved away from using a fitted sheet on the bed, which leaves the guest with a flat sheet on the bottom that twists and bunches by the morning. I was delighted that The Broome still uses both flat and fitted sheetsit is a must for a good nights sleep! The staff is enthusiastic and welcoming. A good stay, indeed!Dear ECWPhD:On behalf of the team, thank you again for staying with us and thank you for sharing your feedback with us. It was a delight welcoming you into our little Oasis. In fact our rooms are designed in and out to offer a little break from the city while you are in the city. We wish to have you back again very soon. Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com."
New York,The Broome,"The Broome is a well-situated, warm and welcoming boutique hotel in the heart of Soho. The rooms are sizable and airy, the staff friendly and knowledgeable and the location superb. My daughter and I had a wonderful time and will definitely return.Dear Bethshorstein:Thank you again for choosing to stay with us at The Broome SoHo NYC and thank you for taking the time to share with us. We really appreciate your feedback and it was a joy having you and your daughter with us. We really hope to get to see you again soon. Until then, if you need anything at all, please do not hesitate to contact us at infothebroomenyc.com."
Boston,W Boston,Bad: When we arrived we were met by a unfriendly doorman and it was so loud due to the bar that we could barely hear the person at reception. Each day the room was made up apparently but barely even folded the sheets. towels weren't folded etc. We have stayed in lots of hotels over the years and had recently stayed at the Loews Boston which was a far far better experience with far friendlier staff. Good: Food was awesome.
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: The parking rates are outrageous (59 USD/day for valet), but this is for all of Boston, not just this hotel. . Good: Great location, very convenient for Boston Commons, subway and good restos. Hotel was very nicely appointed with great products. Wish we had time to use Bliss Spa!"
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: They don't have complementary internet in the room. Good: Love the location, the room was big and very comfortable, love everything about it!"
Boston,W Boston,"Good: Sheet came off and I saw coffee stain on mattress cover. Otherwise, great!"
Boston,W Boston,Bad: The hotel cannot control the metal plate in the road that bangs when cars drive over it all night. Good: The bed was very comfortable and the berries and fresh fruit were awesome! The staff was friendly and more than made up for a mishap with the room reservation.
Boston,W Boston,"The staff, location , room, enjoyed our stay ."
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: Rooms felt old. We had a reservation for 4 but not the towels, cups etc for 4. Hair dryer was weak and insufficient. Bathroom counter were way too low and came to my lower thigh. Killed my back. Brushing teeth, shaving etc. Decor was showing its age. Good: Location near the commons was good. There's a small playground nearby which is good for those with youmg kids."
Boston,W Boston,Bad: I didn't like that someone got stabbed in front of the W hotel on Saturday night. Made me feel really safe! Apparently that's happened before. Good: The atmosphere and cleanliness were great.
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Double beds a little small for 2 people. . Good: Comfortable gym and great gym.
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: Construction at hotel, but obviously it has to be done at sometime or another. Realize that was just just bad luck on out part. Thought the price for the hotel was a little high. Good: Nice staff, Luisa from Potugal could have not been nicer."
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Thermostat was hard to manage. Dining area was ok. Lots of outside options though so that was just a small thing. Good: Location and quality of room
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: Our room was missed one night to clean (we didn't care about the bed, but we needed some supplies). It's OK, not a big deal. Good: Great location to visit Boston. Room was spacious and modern. Overall staff was professional and friendly."
Boston,W Boston,Everything was excellent and the staff were warm and friendly
Boston,W Boston,Bad: no. Good: very good
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: We only had one robe in our room and no slippers, but we weren't bothered enough to ask for these from the front desk. Good: We loved our stay at the W Boston! The room was a great size and the bed huge and comfortable. The staff was so accommodating taking delivery of two packages for me and bringing them up to the room. I didn't use the Bliss spa on site, but it is an amazing spa so I will definitely visit next time!"
Boston,W Boston,Bad: We had the bad luck of staying in a room next to a suite. Our neighbors partied until 5 am. Good: Room and common areas were very nice.
Boston,W Boston,Bad: We were initially given a room close to the gym on same floor - made it very noisy early in the morning so no chance of a lie in. We asked and hotel obliged with a room change to different floor. Good: Bed was comfortable

Boston,W Boston,"Bad: Arrived at reception late evening - it was in the middle of a very busy bar, couldn't hear receptionist. Got in lift and hadn't been told we needed to swipe room key card to get anywhere! Also had to pay per day for wifi!. Good: Beautiful room, good location"

Boston,W Boston,Renovations being done waking up to constant jack hammering Staff super friendly!
Boston,W Boston,"No wifi Simple breakfast with Egg, Ham and Sausage. Nice Coffee Late"
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: Room was a little tired. One of the reading lights was coming off the wall, the seat cushion on the desk chair was peeling, the electric outlet near the bed was a tangle of multi-prong extenders.

Boston,W Boston,"Bad: Nothing much. Good: Modern, Soft beds, Great atmosphere"
Boston,W Boston,Good: I loved the lighting and how comfortable the bed was.
Boston,W Boston,Layout of the hotel and decor was too contemporary. The room was very comfortable
Boston,W Boston,The staff and amenities are excellent!!
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Place.
Boston,W Boston,Good: Very friendly staff. And perfect location in the theater district.
Boston,W Boston,Good: Everything
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Room was terribly dirty. Good: Location
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: I thought the bathroom was a bit small for the space and the physical appearance could have been a bit more modern and sharp. Good: I liked the spacious nature of the room. The bed was super comfortable. The staff were super attentive, helpful and friendly"
Boston,W Boston,Good: The Staff were courteous and very helpful . The Toiletries from Bliss. Love the face wash.
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: Ridiculously noisy, external alarms, cars honking horns through the night and the thumping music till early hours made sleep tricky ! Not a hotel if you like a little peace in the evening. Good: The property location was perfect"
Boston,W Boston,Bad: There was a lot of noise out on the street around 3am. Not the fault of the Hotel. Good: The staff and atmosphere were amazing. The beds were super cozy! Security staff at the hotel were awesome

Boston,W Boston,"Bad: Expensive! I know that it was but the room i expected to be way better as a mega room seemed so regular , the price wasn't worth it . Good: Nice scenery"
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: I was hoping to approve my late departure since my flight was in te evening. Good: Nice staff, helpfull excellent location Soft touches did not experience in many hotels but sure your staff show it"
Boston,W Boston,"Very noisy at night. Seemed to be a number of venues close by which closed around 2 am. Spacious room, very comfortable"
Boston,W Boston,Late night club crowd was a little loud around 2am when the clubs are closing down
Boston,W Boston,Bad: assigned an accessible room without being told. tried to book room direct with hotel but was told tat they could not match thebooking.com rate (even though we were starwood members.. ). Good: bar area
Boston,W Boston,"Good: Wonderful service, awesome riom service menu (especially the late night offerings). Awesome amenities."
Boston,W Boston,Noise Excellent location
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: There was an anti-noise device plugged into each of two sockets to compensate for the fact they are in a noisy road. In fact, this emits itself a loud roaring sound. When unplugged, things were fine. The road noise was not bad at all (we were on the 12th floor). One of the senior staff kindly refunded a breakfast bill given this and another issue (cordless phone by the bed wouldn't stop beeping through the night). The restaurant and room service were extremely expensive. There was a slight sense too that some of the decor (wood-appearance veneer on cabinets, shower curtain not panel ) was a bit cheap and scuffed given the price. Good: Staff were great - thoughtful, friendly and clearly dedicated to running it well.Decor and atmosphere of front lounge area welcoming and stylish. Location is very good."
Boston,W Boston,Big room
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Outside street noises were loud during the late night. Motorcycles racing and taxis honking woke us up. Might have been better with a room not facing Stuart Street. Good: Staff was friendly and helpful! Nice room.
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: How crowded the lobby seemed, mostly with locals having a stance putting out a I'll kick your ass before I move aura. Good: The overall atmosphere was clean and modern, easy to navigate to facilities I needed over stay."
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: The only negative was some mysterious in-room snack bar charges that appeared on my bill after I left. I contacted the hotel, and they promptly removed them. This has happened to me at other Starwood properties before, and I'm not sure why. Good: The hotel is in a great location and is clean/modern with a courteous staff. The room I was in was spacious and quiet, and had everything I needed."
Boston,W Boston,Bad: The only draw back is the noise at night from th people coming in and out of the lounge and adjacent nightclub. Though it didn't bother us personally. Good: I loved how central the location was. The hotel is in the theatre district. We walked to the harbour as well as Shopping and all the parks around us. After a long day of walking around we enjoyed A massage at the Bliss spa. We also enjoyed having a drink at the lounge before going to bed. It was a great experience for us. It might be too noisy for people who want peace and quite. I also had the best sleep in those beds. I would recommend staying at the W Boston.
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: it's good hotel , but the price it's so expensive !!!!. Good: it's good hotel , but the price it's so expensive !!!!"
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Within the first 15 minutes of being there we got a complaint from a neighbor for having music too loud. The speaker was not even up half way and it was 4 oclock in the afternoon on a Saturday. At the end of the night staff were rude.
Boston,W Boston,no very good
Boston,W Boston,Bad: When I booked my room it said that that parking was included in the price I paid. But when we got there that wasn't the case!.
Boston,W Boston,Good: The beds
Boston,W Boston,Bad: The price of the wifi. Good: Everything
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: The doormen could have reacted a bit quicker to open the inner doors, which were very heavy. They sprang into action for the outer doors, but saw a dad with buggy struggle to get through, and people with cases, let in through the outside door, and having to open the inner door themselves with luggage. Good: The welcome was great. Staff were helpful and interested. The room was stylish and spacious, with great facilities in the room like iPod Dock."
Boston,W Boston,Good: great location Good services
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Room was small -- terrible view!. Good: Location
Boston,W Boston,Bad: price. Good: everything
Boston,W Boston,"Bad: This is one of the worst hotels I have stayed in my career. Out of hotel stays in 29 countries, hotel W made the top of the list in poor customer relations, poor cleanliness, and horrible problem resolution. First they gave me an occupied room, then they down graded me to a lower grade room over night. The next day they didn't even clean our room when we returned, and they gave away the original room they were hold for me. The suites bathroom smelled like urine so bad and when we complained, it still was not cleaned by that evening. I had to fight with the hotel to apply a discount rate they never even offered. They have a slogan what ever when ever I can't say they once lived by that motto. This is not my first time at the W hotel organization but it certainly will be my last! Deplorable customer experience and engagement."
Boston,W Boston,Bad: A/C in the room didn't work at first but was fixed. Good: Great experience
Boston,W Boston,"Good: very expensive, Wi-Fi as an extra cost is ridiculous given room charge"
Boston,W Boston,Good: Great lobby/lounge area. Good casual work spaces. Free wifi a major plus!
Boston,W Boston,I waited way too long at the front desk to check-in and out
Boston,W Boston,Good: Great property! Excellent team of young dedicated profeccionals
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Check in staff was rude. Concierge never called back after leaving my information. Doors slamming in hallway could hear in my room. Double Queen Room was not a true Queen size. Have to pay for wifi. Good: Atmosphere Bedding Location
Boston,W Boston,Bad: Bathroom doors. Good: Lovely room. Good size.
Miami,"Mandarin Oriental, Miami","My wife will thank me forever. Wonderful hotel in Miami, not on the main beach strip but I would say in a better position, if what you want to do is relax and enjoy the area. The rooms were superb and we had one with a huge balcony overlooking the harbour and pool. Breakfast was just and simply amazing especially when sitting outside in the morning. Pool area well maintained and serviced by staff. There are very few amenities outside of the hotel, one has to walk for about 10 minutes to get to shops etc. Concierge services was very helpful, a big shout out to Carlos who was the most helpful concierge guy we had come across for a while, he is a mine of information about the local area. This hotel oozes luxury and very family friendly, my family of 4 was really looked after, Two small gripes, the hotel should have somewhere in the evening where a family can enjoy drinks and desserts, that is not the bar, very often we could not get a space there in the evening or felt uncomfortable to be there with kids, the other point being in room dining could be improved, the menu was a bit short for us and the kitchen was not flexible enough to tailor some dishes, for example making the pasta spicy, we ordered some rice with our chicken and it was just undercooked , it was changed immediately and we were given complimentary glasses of wine but it was too late when one is starving !"
Boston,"The Ritz-Carlton, Boston","We stayed at the Ritz for 5 nights in a club levelSuite. Location was wonderful, right by Boston Common and multiple T stops. Service was wonderful, especially from the concierge, front desk and club lounge staff. Staff made my 4 young children feel special and they enjoyed the scavenger hunt and little toys provided. The room was lovely and well appointed though a little smaller than it appeared in the website. I would definitely stay here again when I Boston! In fact Im planning on a business trip to Cambridge soon and considering staying here and commuting.Dear mnmorange,So glad to hear you enjoyed your recent stay with your family at The Ritz-Carlton, Boston, with all of the city so easily accessible just outside our doors. It is wonderful to know that you and your children were well taken care of by the friendly and professional ladies and gentlemen throughout the hotel. Thank you for taking the time to comment on your visit. We hope you will return for that upcoming business trip - getting to Cambridge from the hotel is a breeze - as well as many more occasions, when it will be our sincere pleasure to welcome you back.Warmest regards,William P.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"Service was outstanding from the valet, bellman, front desk to the butler. Everyone is top notch. The location is great, a few blocks from Central Park and shopping. The rooms have great decor and the right size.Dear YoYoMass, Thank you for choosing The St. Regis hotel amongst the hundreds of hotels in New York City to enjoy your recent visit. We appreciate your kind comments on TripAdvisor and hope to welcome you again. Sincerely, Octavia Marginean Hotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Checking in was the worst part of my experience. As I was standing in line to check in, there was one person in front of me who was being assisted and two other guests in line behind me also waiting to check in with only one front desk employee. I was in line for 7 minutes and never did the lady at the front desk make eye contact with me or signal her customer to hold on while she got some other employees to assist her. It was rude, unprofessional and totally unacceptable from any hotel of thus caliber. 2 minutes is the maximum amount of time you should wait before being acknowledged. Clearly the staff needs better training. That frustration aside, at approximately 6pm I ran into a friend from back home who was waiting for her room. She arrived at 4 and had been relegated to wait at the bar because there were no rooms available to honor her reservation. She had theater tickets and needed her room, so at her behest I inquired to the manager about its status. The manager was apologetic but couldn't guarantee when the room would become available. In the end it all worked out, but the my being neglected at check-in and her room not being ready are two things that you should never experience at a hotel like the St. Regis. Yes the rooms are nice, yes the hotel is well maintained, but the service is for me the most important, and the service that I experienced was slightly below average.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"Le St.-Rgis est incroyable. What a gorgeous hotel and what an upscale experience you will live by staying there. It was a dream come true. And if it wasn't enough, I bumped into Kate Mara in the elevator. I tried to act cool but totally failed. The rooms are perfect. The staff is perfect. Every square inch is clean and every detail was taken care of. I was lucky enough to have dinner in La Salle de Bal. It was fantastic.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"Stayed here for two nights and had a great time. This hotel has the best redemption for SPG points value, and we took advantage to pamper ourselves. It was really very nice, though one mishap occurred when we were billed for something in the bar that we didn't order. The reception cleared it for us right away without the hassle we may of experienced at some other hotel. We didn't receive the 5th Ave view we were hoping for, but that's only fair when using points. Would definitely stay again.Dear Rose2li, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent visit to New York City.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"I've been taking my wife here for her birthday for the past 5 years. We stay either 5 or 6 days. Great location, great service. The desk staff are always helpful. Usually we get to take the Bentley for a ride to the Frick or another museum. That's a special treat for me. Last year they put us in a temporary room so we could take a nap until our reserved room was ready, then they upgraded us to a suite which was OMG. I couldn't believe how nice they were. We start every morning with the butler service coffee and something my wife packs for us. We are already looking forward to our stay in December 2016 and we just got tickets to The Comet to complement our stay. Oh, I forgot to mention it's an easy walk to Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. I tried booking for December 2017 but it's still too early but I will book as soon as they let me.Dear ms2020, We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.We aim to offer our guests a chic home away from home while they sojourn in the city and are delighted to have had you at the property!Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel on TripAdvisor, and we will see you in December!Please contact me directly at octavia.margineanstregis.com and I might be able to arrange your 2017 trip as well.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"Between the front desk (too many greats to name) to Hussain and Israel (tenth floor butlers), to the great staff at King Cole's, this is an excellent property. I have stayed in the Four Seasons, Ritz, and elsewhere, and found this to be a great place. Highly appreciated. Room was great, but as is clear from the hotel business, property is secondary to service.Service rules, and the St Regis staff is excellent. Kudos to Krista the concierge (not to miss the stars). I recommend this hotel. Expensive, yes, but value received.Dear rowingman,Thank you so much for sharing your kind words about our staff. Our team makes it our mission to provide genuine service to each and every guest and we are so pleased that you experienced this firsthand. We will share your feedback with Hassan, Israel, Krista, and the team! We hope to see you again soon at The St. Regis New York.Kindly,Hermann W. ElgerGeneral Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Quality of this hotel is exceptional. Arguably the best service and quality of room, restaurants and bar that we have ever experienced. The restaurant for breakfast was great and the bar at cocktail time was typical of a New York happy hour, loud and happy.Dear Richard K, We appreciate your review on TripAdvisor of our hotel and we are delighted that you have made The St. Regis Hotel your new home away from home. We will share with our team your praises and we are thankful for your visit. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Here for business meetings, had some glitches with services like wifi and AV but we're fixed immediately, even though they were our mistakes not the hotel's.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"I love the location, the staff, the restaurants, THE BAR, the rooms and all of the extra services that are offered here where staff remember so many little details about previous trips that each return is like an extended day from the last stay."
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Amazing hotel, great service . They make you feel like you are their main concern . The rooms are amazing very clean, and equipped with every thing.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"I love the St Regis (generally speaking but especially the New York). I've stayed here 12 times over the last 4 years or so. It just seems to get better each time. Tire's a great new feature which is the Rooms control Manager (Molly) emailing me ahead of time to see when we would be arriving. My SPG upgrade available when we arrived at about 1015AM which is rare these days. Then there is the front desk staff - they are all wonderful but I want to call out Shelomie and Hugo who know Ryne and I by name and immediately make us feel at home. How about that concierge desk - again all are great but today I'll call out Krista and McKinley. I emailed while on the plane about getting in to the Salon for Mani and a shave. Our appointments were made and ready for when we arrived. Our Butler this trip was Marianna. She is awesome and gave us the utmost service during our stay. Finally Kevin and Juan our In Room dining attendants - just as perfect as can be. I named names because this is what this place is about. Consistent and friendly staff that makes The St Regis our home away form home. We really love it.Dear Kenneth,Thank you so much for taking the time to not only share your feedback regarding your most recent visit, but also to be so detailed and generous with your comments about our team members. Molly, Shelomie, Hugo, Krista, McKinley, Marianna, Kevin, and Juan are indeed amongst our most stellar performers and we could not be happier to learn that they made your and Ryne's visit enjoyable and memorable. Rest assured that they will receive the well-deserved recognition.Please come back soon! We want to be your home away from home many more times to come!Happy New Year!!!Daniela on behalf of All Your SRNY Friends"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"On my most recent work trip to NYC, I chose to stay at the St Regis vs my usual (The Peninsula). Never again will I go back. After a long day of client meetings, I decided to grab a light dinner and drink at the hotel lobby bar (King Cole Bar). I travel quite a bit for work and my one rule of thumb is to avoid being holed up in a room with room service. I headed straight to the bar after getting back to the hotel and intentionally grabbed a small table in the far corner as I knew I'd need to get some work in to clear all my emails from the day. Literally within 15 seconds of powering on my laptop, one of the servers bolted over to me and asked if I was aware that they had a No Laptop Policy after 4pm. Seriously I had to ask myself, was I really staying at a 5-star business property I politely pushed back and said I was a guest at the hotel and had to get some work done and would be out of there quickly after my meal. He looked annoyed but then retreated.Fast forward 15-20 minutes...my food and wine arrives and I'm not even halfway through. That's when the FB manager then approaches me. He actually had the audacity to ask how much longer will I be on my laptop as I am being disruptive. Again, to set the context, I am sitting in the far corner next to a pillar and had my laptop screen dimmed to the lowest setting. I am not engaging with anyone yet I'm being disruptive One would think an FB manager would have some business and common sense and decency to recognize that you don't go and ask a paying guest at the hotel to get up in the middle of a meal because they are working on their laptop. When I told him I didn't understand their policy and why he was enforcing it, he said I was not fitting in to the bar scene. Unbelievable. He then tells me he'd be happy to have my food and wine moved outside the bar where I could freely work. I am at this point just dumbfounded. It was like being asked to move to the back of the bus or get off the bus for that matter. Most humiliating and distasteful experience ever and never ever would I have imagined it would be on a work trip at what's supposed to be an upstanding hotel. And just to be clear, on the many occasions I've had to power up my laptop at the bar at The Peninsula to get some work done, not once did anyone ask me to turn off my laptop or leave. Crystal clear for me now...Dear sfellelle, On behalf of the Management team at The St. Regis New York, we would like to thank you for your visit. We appreciate you taking the time to detail your recent stay at our property.Our hotel prides itself on providing five star service, yet in some cases, mistakes can occur. We apologize for the experience that you encountered in our Food and Beverage department, and please know that this is certainly not our standard. Rest assured, we took the necessary measures to do an internal follow up with our staff to ensure that all our guests have a flawless experience in our bar in the future in similar circumstances.We most certainly hope you will give us another opportunity to service you again in the future. Please don't hesitate to contact me directly to book your next visit or to discuss in length your experience at: Octavia.margineanstregis.com. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"We spent 5 nights here in a regular room in December. The good: We loved the building's character, and old NYC charm. The location can't be beat. The butlers were overall very helpful, especially Emina. The car service is lovely, and the driver we had (Robert) was very nice. The concierges were interacted with (I have forgotten names) were both superb. Housekeeping was OUTSTANDING after the first night. Very much appreciated. The bell staff and doormen were also mostly really great. We felt very welcomed most of the time we interacted with staff.The not as good: A few minor misses upon entering room for the first time - there was some debris from prior guests. One of the butlers didn't provide the same great service as the others. Nothing to be totally fussed about, but these misses stand out all the more against the otherwise stellar service. Really the only true disappointment was that we weren't impressed by our Room Service breakfast at all - best to skip.Overall, we really enjoyed our time here and do recommend if it fits your NYC plans.Dear Nakoa G,Thank you very much for reviewing your recent stay at The St. Regis New York. We greatly appreciate you taking the time to write you review and provide us with your feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your room and the Butler service, but are disappointed that you were not impressed with your Room Service breakfast. We will share your thoughts with our Food Beverage team and will be sure to address this internally. We hope to have an opportunity to welcome you back on your next trip to New York City.Kindest Regards,Senih GerayGeneral Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Of course it is very beautiful, and from its look you might think that it would be stuffy, but it is not- Very friendly and welcoming staff, and the Head Butler, Nestor, on the 7th floor could not have been a better representative in making us feel at home! Best Hotel in NYC- have stayed in many , luxury and not,in NYC and all over the world. Actually always wanted to stay at the St. Regis, and this did not disappoint!Dear Diane,We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoyed your stay, and that Nestor made you feel at home. Our Signature Butler service differentiates us from the competition, and we are thrilled that you were able to experience this first hand.We look forward to welcoming you back to New York again soon.Kindest Regards,Senih Geray"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"We took a break from shopping and treated ourselves to a cocktail in the famous King Cole bar at the St Regis. Great experience, it was fairly quiet and we were able to enjoy our drinks and have a chat with Mathias - who made our visit a fun experience.Can certainly recommend and will try to return before we head back to England!Dear grarus, Thank you for visiting our King Cole Bar, the home of The Bloody Mary and Maxfield Parrish Art Nouveau masterpiece the mural behind the King Cole Bar. We are thrilled you enjoyed your drinks. We hope you have a chance to visit again before your trip back to Europe. Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"We hadn't stayed at the St. Regis for many years. We decided to try it again for a 2 night stay to celebrate our anniversary. We were upgraded to a larger suite than we had reserved. It was a beautifully appointed room with all the modern amenities. It was a smart room that had all the controls for the lighting and draperies from either room.We had a beautiful view of 5th avenue from our living room. The room came with butler service which was a great amenity.The best part of the St. Regis besides the wonderful rooms is definitely the location. You step out of the hotel and you're in the middle of a shopper's paradise. Every designer store is at your doorstep. So if you want to shop till you drop it's a great location. You're also steps away from Central Park and all the wonderful museums we have in New York City.The St. Regis has it all, great service, beautiful rooms and a perfect location. Looking to return soon to enjoy being in the city!Dear MissS85, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your special occasion. Happy Anniversary and many more happy years to come!On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels which we pride ourselves on.Thank you for your time in reviewing our property on TripAdvisor, and please let us know when you will be returning, as we would love to have you as our guest.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Stopped in for mimosas and coffee while shopping in 5th Avenue. Where else can you get a Veuve Cliquot Mimosa Beautiful, nostalgic, old world. They also have a Nat King Cole Bar with wonderful history.Dear Cheriejay, Thank you very much for your kind words. We are pleased that you enjoyed your mimosa at our iconic King Cole Bar, and we hope to welcome you back again soon. Kindly, Senih Geray General Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"I stayed in a huge two-room suite here, and I just don't understand the appeal. Perhaps my tastes are just not, ahem, refined enough, but I found the hotel to be a bit stuffy and uninspiring. This was the 3rd or 4th St. Regis that I've stayed at, and I finally realized that the brand just isn't for me. I guess I prefer more modern or unique hotels. It wasn't a bad experience, and the separate living room would be helpful for entertaining a certain type of client, but I wouldn't stay here alone and I wouldn't stay here for a romantic trip.The service was spectacular in the suite, and included a private butler. That said, I don't really need a private butler when I stay in a hotel. The front desk workers were friendly if not downright charming. The hotel lobby is small and, for my tastes, uninteresting. It lacks the wow factor. The concierge was very good, but seemed to sigh when he realized I had such pedestrian questions such as what new broadway shows might be worth seeing (I've been to NYC more than 30 times, but I always ask the basics).For the money, I'd pick the Waldorf Astoria or the Gramercy Park hotel for its warm, sumptuous colors and textures (in the larger rooms) or even the Mandarin Oriental.Note - I stayed in this hotel in 2014.Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your stay with us.We are sorry to learn that the style of our historical property did not meet your preferences, but are glad to read that you enjoyed our team's service. As far as our Concierge is concerned, rest assured I will personally follow-up and use your feedback as a re-training opportunity.When Mr. John Jacob Astor and his wife Caroline built the hotel in 1904, on purpose, they wanted to have a very small lobby to make the arrival experience of their friends and family members as intimate and as home-like as possible. While we treasure and value the heritage of our hotel, we do realize that the lobby size might not be of a wow factor and we apologize if you were disappointed.Hopefully you will visit us again and give us more opportunities to be at your service.Have a wonderful start of the new year!!Sincerely,DanielaOn behalf of The St. Regis New York Team"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"My wife and I stayed at the St Regis for 8 nights in June 2018 as part pleasure part business trip. This was our second time at the hotel and we cannot fault it. The staff were exceptional and made our stay very memorable. The hotel's location made it great to get around the City and the friendliness of the staff made our time there very enjoyable. Janelle in the fitness centre was a particular favourite of ours as she made going to the gym in the mornings a very welcoming and friendly experience. We will definitely stay here upon our return to New York CityDear GK1708,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"In the words of Shirley Bassey: Where do I begin Jajaja. Well the rooms are sumptuous and big! Especially by NYC standards and compared to hotels of the same category. The service is amazing you feel pampered all throughout your stay. The food unfortunately is not up to the standard of the hotel. This doesn't mean it's bad at all, yet nothing spectacular. And last but not least the best part is that it has the best location!Dear CutbertoParraNicolin, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor. We hope to see you again soon!Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Stayed 1 night as an SPG Gold member through the Amex Platinum Fine Hotels Resorts program. The hard product at the property is good but let down by extraordinarily bad service - hands down the worst received at any 5* luxury hotel.- On reserving, the hotel insisted that as a couple with a young child, we must book a rollaway bed at an extra charge and we could not share one king bed for health and safety reasons. Accepting the higher rate charge, on arrival, there was no rollaway provided. Luckily we didn't want one but they were extremely insistent on this fact when booking.- No welcome amenity offered as SPG Gold member.- Check-in experience went from cold and marginally polite to confrontational. Hotel would not honor the contractual one-category if available upgrade of the Amex FHR program. The hotel's own website defines these room categories for sale: superior, deluxe, grand luxe rooms, then 1 bedroom suites. Within the 1 bedroom suite category, the room types are Astor, Deluxe, Madison. Having booked a grand luxe room, at checkin their website showed availability for Deluxe and Madison suites. The agent insisted their obligation was only a one-room type upgrade, and not a category upgrade (which means any room type in that category). Therefore as no Astor suite was available, no upgrade for us.- I spoke to the Front Desk Manager, Susan, who insisted their interpretation of the FHR contract was correct. Having now spent 20 mins waiting for them to check round the back as they put it, with nowhere offered for my family to sit, I just wanted to get to a room. I then called Amex, who contacted the hotel. Unfortunately by this point Susan had allocated the available Deluxe suites to other guests or at least blocked them, and lied to my Amex agent claiming that I had been seeking an upgrade to a Madison suite worth 1000 extra, and the contract prohibits a triple room type upgrade. I don't appreciate the hotel manipulating their inventory, nor lying to my Amex agent when my request was for a Deluxe suite allowable by the FHR contract and worth only approx 200-300 more. Amex advise the hotel clearly has different definitions of available and category and these do not equate to available for sale on their website and category of room as listed on their website - sounds like they are happy to use different definitions to deny loyalty benefits.- On being shown to our room, the agent advised a butler would introduce himself in a couple of minutes. One hour later, no butler. I page the butler and receive a call back, requesting a champagne ice bucket and child amenities (these weren't provided even though child was listed on the reservation). Another hour later, still no sign of anything. Page the butler again, received the amenities... never received the requested ice bucket. Last we ever saw of the butler. No offer of many of the complimentary services as advertised on their website, but nice of them to provide tea cookies/milk.- Ordered room service dinner (with the still missing ice bucket) - quality was very average for the price and beware families, this hotel charges an 8 per PERSON room service charge which I have never encountered at any other hotel. So a family of 3 would pay a whopping 24 in addition to mandatory 20 gratuity and sales tax. The waiter advised us just to lie and say we are just one person next time! Called for the trays/trolley to be collected, 90mins later nobody had come and it was collected by housekeeping at turndown.- Tried to organise family activities through the concierge as advertised on their website, they acknowledged our request but never heard back from them after that. - Advertised functionality to stream your iPad media to the hotel TV does not work.- Included complimentary breakfast worth 41 is the most basic continental breakfast ever seen, consisting solely of 4 pastries, coffee and one orange juice. - On checkout, the agent's only words from walking to the desk were Mr , here is your bill, let me correct this error, hope to see you again. No how was your stay or anything similar.When paying four figures to stay in a hotel room, this doesn't meet any expectations and this stay was our first and last at a St Regis.Dear msnz,Please allow us to thank you for posting your review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our Director of Rooms has connected with you privately and we hope you are satisfied with the resolution. We hope to be at your service again soon and, until then, please contact our executive office for any additional assistance you may need.Kind Regards,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"This was my second stay at the St Regis NY. The hotel has been revamped is much more expensive bit i can't say it has much improved. On the bright side: got an upgrade and a very nice room, late checkout, the concierges are knowledgeable and get you in difficult places like the Polo Bar across the street.downsides: the Ducasse restaurant is gone and hasn't been replaced so you're left with a somewhat lame breakfast/diner lounge. The King Cole must be run trotskyists since i was refused entry before midnight despite identifying myself as an hotel guest. I duly complained and next day was served a deliberate over spicy bloody mary in what felt like retaliation. The hotel as a butler service that packs your stuff on demand. I lost i cherished Lanvin fedora on the process without so much of an excuse. Considering the price you pay you can find better options in NY. By the way i'm an SPG Gold so the upgrades and late check outs come with the status.Dear Joao C, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"With an air of urban sophistication and a location that can't be beat The St. Regis occupies the corner of 5th and 55th only blocks from Central Park, MOMA and the best retail shopping in America. On a cold winter afternoon loaded with bags displaying the logos of the finest brands guests are greeted at the elevator with a choice of hot apple cider, chocolate or beef broth. Recently remodeled rooms are roomy by NYC standards and fresh and of course the Butler service puts it's over the top. I don't think you can find a better lounge for a casual drink then the King Cole Bar. Don't miss the Bloody Mary menu (a drink that was invented here). An oasis, a grand hotel, a total pleasure.Dear Gene B,Thank you very much for your kind words about our hotel. We are so pleased that you enjoyed your stay in a renovated room and were able to enjoy our holiday hot chocolate offering.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"I have stayed for New Year's Holiday.I was looking forward to visiting this hotel very very much. and I requested to them that I would like a high floor at their web site while reservation. as a result,my timeline on arrival day is following.11:30 arrival at Hotel,and deposit luggage. the representative of reception saidWe accept your request. at this time.15:45 Challenge for the first check-in. But the another representative told me that Check-intime start from 16:00.16:00 2nd challenge to check-in. new another representative said the inspection of your room hasn't complete yet. wait for several minute the long line made by waiting check-in people were appeared from this time. 16:15 3rd challenge to check-in. next another representative said the inspection isn't yet.wait for 5-10min. I answered OK,I wait for at here(front desk) the long line has become much longer.16:50 4th challenge to check-in. no one tell me anything.I try to talk to another person who stand the next of front desk I am waiting for 45 minutes,Whyto tell you the truth,I had expected this time a little.because I thought this waiting time was the time to find the highfloor room I requested. 17:00 check-in done.the room assigned to me was...the most lowest floor(3rd).there are 20 floors in this hotel and I had requested higher floorsince 2 month ago,But the answer was the most lowest level.I was so sad...so sad. the attached picture is the View from this room.If the assigned floor was 4th floor,I think I was saved from this sadness.But 3rd...the most lowest floor to the guest who request high floor.I know this season is very busy.I don't want to complain more than that.The hospitality and smile of their staffs were very good.I'll stay this hotel again.maybe this month.Dear 376masatot, Thank you very much for feedback about your recent stay with us.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"I loved this hotel. It captures a distinctive golden age vibe in a very special way. On check-in, there was a small disturbance in the lobby due to the behaviour of another guest who was unhappy with her allocated room. The only blip during our stay was that the room we were allocated with an external view was clearly given to this complaining guest. The manager literally took the key from the hands of the lady checking us in as she was giving them to me (and after we had been told what a lovely room we had been allocated)... But the hotel was professional enough to deal with our concern immediately, and we were given a gorgeous external view room facing onto Fifth Avenue and complimentary breakfast and drinks. This rapid commitment to service was indicative of the rest of our stay. Otherwise, the whole stay was perfect. The room was elegant. It felt very classic and luxurious, but also had any modern convenience. The King Cole bar was the perfect place to meet friends. The complimentary Bentley was a special touch to drop us to dinner at a perfect concierge recommendation. We loved the atmosphere in the hotel restaurant the next morning for breakfast. I would stay here again without hesitation. We felt valued and special.Dear johntillett, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"The good First let's talk about the great things at this flagship hotel and there are so many! The location is in my opinion is as good as it gets in NYC! Two blocks from Saks, Museum of Modern Art and St Patrick's Cathedral, one block from Madison Ave, three blocks from Central Park and the city's best restaurants within easy walking distance. Everything is at your fingertips! The architecture of this iconic building is absolutely stunning and St Regis keeps it in tip top condition with gleaming marble flooring, 24 carat accents and sparkling crystal chandeliers, all as you would expect and more. The Christmas decor from the massive toy soldiers at the entrance to the golden leafed apple tree in the foyer were absolutely stunning! Hats off to the extraordinary designer!The rooms and suites are spacious and tastefully decorated with marble foyers, crystal chandeliers, deep crown moldings, luxurious fabrics and marble bathrooms with double sinks, TV in the mirror, deep soaker tub, separate shower and European-style private flush. The beds are as comfortable as any you will find at the finest hotels in the world. The full time butlers are efficient and friendly welcoming you upon arrival with tea and coffee and each morning as well. They look after your every need from shoe shine to pressing efficiently and pleasantly. Fresh fruit awaits you and is daily replenished. Wi-Fi is included, as is bottled water which is replenished twice daily with the maid service. The mini bar is well stocked and there is ample closet space with plenty of hangers. The rooms and entire hotel are spotlessly clean! All the staff are friendly from the doormen, waiters, maids, valets, etc. We opted out for the Platinum breakfast choice and it was a daily delight in Astor Court with a nice menu selection, well prepared and quickly served.The Bad Being an SPG member for 16 years with over 900 nights to date and Lifetime Platinum status we expected to be upgraded to a suite upon arrival which is the SPG policy. It is something we have always received at all SPG properties, 100 of the time since gaining Platinum status many, many years ago. We booked this trip six months in advance so it wasn't like they didn't know we were coming. We even processed our Suite Nights Awards certificates to further ensure the upgrade. We had saved those upgrades for this trip but since they expire Dec 31/15 they are useless to us now. Our first bad experience was upon arrival at the front desk where the clerk informed us that we would not be upgraded. It went from bad to worse as she told us that we were not entitled to the upgrade. She didn't seem to understand the Platinum perks. Talking with her was like talking to a wall, so unlike other 5-star hotels we've stayed which are usually so highly trained and informed. We were shown to our Grand Luxe guestroom which is a very lovely room as far as rooms go. I will say if you were ever not going to receive an upgrade these rooms are as lovely as it gets. Over the years I hate to think what my husband has spent at SPG hotel stays to have earned his Lifetime Platinum status which is not a gift which the desk clerk seem to indicate but very expensive to achieve. Not receiving the upgrade was such an insult to my husband who has stayed as many as 154 nights in one year alone with SPG. He was very upset and disappointed as we were really looking forward to this stay not having been to NYC on a Thanksgiving holiday since 1985 when we met and had our very first trip together! Of course when you don't get a suite you don't get the toiletries that go with it which I've always loved at the St Regis. I suppose I could have requested it but I didn't. We just settled into our room prepared to make the best of a nice holiday.The Ugly Staying at the hotel for a week, one of the expected highlights was Thanksgiving Dinner at Astor Court. We thought we'd stay in-house after long hours watching the Macy's Parade. Huge mistake! Upon arrival at Astor Court we were seated in the bar at a small round table with 2 tiny bar chairs! We couldn't believe it and should have left but where do you go at this late date The meal was worse then I can describe and actually included processed turkey! Not even real turkey. I couldn't understand why I was sent a form at home to sign prior to arrival so they could charge our credit card a week before the dinner. Now I know! No one in their right mind would pay 400 USD for that miserable meal for two people. I can't adequately describe our disappointment. We have always loved this hotel and enjoyed wonderful special occasions with delicious meals such as New Year's Eve but even the dinner time room service food was horrid. We couldn't even eat the salads. What kind of chef can't make a salad. Seems the breakfast chef was great and the evening chef was worse than lacking. Talking with the room manager was a waste of time upon check out we saw that she gave us a 200 credit on our account for having sat us in the bar for Thanksgiving Dinner! That just added insult to injury as during the conversation she called my husband by the wrong name no less than six times although we kept correcting her. I don't think I could ever get my husband to go back and truthfully I can't blame him. It's a shame that such a gorgeous establishment with so many great long time staff should suffer because of the lack of a decent chef in what should be a 5-star dining room! After visiting 6 other St Regis Hotels in the past with their exquisite chefs to experiencing this in their NYC hotel just doesn't even make sense!Dear Katherine B,Thank you for taking the time to submit your recent review on Trip Advisor. We understand that our leadership team has been in touch with you while you were on property and again after your stay.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"Our son made the arrangement for us to stay here for one night after a short staying in another SPG hotel. We were not too sure whether it would be worth the move for an one night stay! My husband was just recently out of the hospital, and still uses a walker. We thought of the problems with the holiday traffic on the Fifth Ave, getting in and out of the car, and walk up the steps/stairs.....In stead of walking up the steps, we used the elevator located inside the King Cole Bar and Salon next door. Once we stepped into the lobby of St. Rigis, our worries went off the chimney! There seemed to be a special flowery cent in the air as you walked on the shiniest marble designed floors of the hotel. We sat comfortably awaiting for the checking-in. Due to the upgrade to a room with two doubles, we had to wait for a while which was perfectly fine. After a short wait, we were thoughtfully offered to wait in another room to rest until our room was ready. The idea that the management would do that for us has won us over!St. Regis is an one of a kind classy hotel with the old world class charm and beauty. Once inside the room, we were impressed with the modern update using the computer technology, among them: the TV screen fit right into the bathroom mirror would earn a wow factor the 4 types of lightening controls located both near the bed and the entrance of the room was a plus in convenience and lacquer-like Chinese cabinet under the TV to hind the refrigerator and bar was a combo of beauty and convenience. The huge multi-plated mirrors which occupied the entire wall, and the crystals hanging on the chandelier were practically spotless, so were the intricate moldings around the ceiling and the chandelier. The decoration of the room has a luxury feel yet they are just as practical and comfortable as solid every day furniture. The shower which is a separate unit has great water pressure. The tub equipped with the hang-over rack was a perfect way for a relax soak after long walks at the Macy's parade. The marble/stone bath room is spacious and modern which again is a pleasant surprise found in an old hotel. Among those who came to stay and walked those hallways beyond the glass entrance doors on each floor were Eva Gardiner and Salvador Dali, so we were told when first were lead into our room. I must say that we felt just as welcome as any entertainers and/or artists when we were greeted by the staff. As we walked out of the room, as we got in or out of the car, we were greeted politely and warmly. People who stay here for a day or a week are lucky to enjoy the world class luxury, and those who are associated with this first rate elegant hotel appear to be happy and proud to be part of this perfect corporation.Dear goplace42, We are humbled by your complimentary review of your recent stay at our hotel. Thank you for allowing us to provide you with superior and thoughtful service and most importantly, we thank you for making us your new favorite hotel.Sincerely, Octavia Marginean"

New York,The St. Regis New York,"This was our second stay at the St. Regis, and this time we booked through American Express Platinum concierge. As part of their fine hotel's program, we booked for 2 days and the third night was comped. It also included 100.00 towards meals and complete breakfast for 2. Upon checking in, Hugo acknowledged me as a Platinum SPG guest and upgraded us to the Madison Suite! Every room comes with a butler, who will bring you complimentary tea or coffee service. There's a house Bentley which is available on a first come,first served basis.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"I have never been a bite snob but I must say that St. Regis is starting to spoil me. The NY hire is superb and really adds to the stay. Other hotels in NY are so small and the St. Regis revamped its hotel and made all the rooms larger-and nicer. And it shows. Fruit is delivered each night. And not only do you get one piece of chocolate but an entire tray each night. It really got ridiculous because I just ate it all and it was really too much (work on the self control). Luckily they had a great work out room open 24 hours and I used it every evening. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. It is a rare opportunity for me to stay there and I took full advantage. The bottom line is if you get the chance, stay here. Anyone who says this hire is terrible should be banned from staying anywhere but their own home. The service is exceptional. I left a shirt at the hotel and they tracked it down for me and delivered it with personalized service. They literally made me feel that finding my shirt was the most important mission for the entire hotel staff. It is just a level of service rarely seen any more and entirely refreshing (as long as you don't mind the price).Dear JD, It was truly a pleasure having you as our guest during your recent business trip to New York City and glad we were able to assist with tracking down your missing garment.On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we are so pleased that you were able to experience our hotel and enjoy the high service and quality levels upon which we pride ourselves. Thank you for taking the time to review our property on TripAdvisor, and we look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmly,Hermann ElgerGeneral Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Just got back from an amazing weekend at the St. Regis. We used our starpoints to reserve a night at the St. Regis in celebration of our anniversary. I had high hopes for a Category 7 hotel - and St. Regis did not disappoint! We'd had a bit of a rough journey, but from the moment Pascal took our bags to Jose at the front desk checking us in, Ildna showing me to the fitness room where I could have a little workout before our room was ready - everyone took such great care of us. We will definitely be back!Dear Traveller94115, We are very pleased to learn that Pascal, Jose and Ilona all provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.

Marble, crystals, golden leaf paintings, elegantly decorated rooms combining newest technology and extreme comfort in a charming style that one may find somehow a little bit Marie Antoinette. Kind staff, great Doorman from Bretagne, Champagne sabotage at the Bar. Maybe some room for improvement on the side of the kitchen to refine the bar menu and breakfast. A wonderful home feel.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"We hadn't visited the St. Regis Hotel in New York before, and I'll admit to having been a little wary. There are certain Grande Dame hotels in the Starwood portfolio that are a little past their shelf life, and looking a bit beaten up and in need of TLC. Not so the incredibly beautiful and fastidiously maintained St. Regis New York. This is a hotel that literally glistens with fresh paint, fresh scrubbing, fresh upholstery, sparkling crystal, and obsessive attention paid to every detail down to the weight of the stationery and the bulbs in the light fixtures. The desk staff was immediately friendly and accommodating. We asked for an SPG upgrade and were prepared for the usual few added square feet or better view. What we were given was the Fifth Avenue Suite, a truly grand and beautiful collection of rooms, palatial by Manhattan apartment standards, with a view of Fifth Avenue below. Like the rest of the hotel, the room was spotless, freshly refurbished, and offered two bathrooms, a generous walk-in closet, a fridge, and a host of creature comforts. Couldn't have asked for better.The Concierge staff were on their game and steered us to some terrific smaller restaurants we hadn't visited before. Every phone call to room service, the front desk, and housekeeping was met with a thoughtful, friendly, and always helpful voice at the other end. This is one of those hotels that reflects well on its demanding management and training standards, and every employee we met was professional and incredibly helpful and friendly. And every last one seemed aware and proud of the hotel's origins, history, and ambition to be the best at what it does.Minor gripes: Certain rooms in the hotel offer Butler Service, a tradition and pride of the St. Regis since its opening in 1904. We found the service a little awkward to use. When you phone the Butler, you hear a tone then a shrill whistle on the phone similar to reaching a fax machine. We weren't sure what this was about, so we phoned the hotel operator who said this was the paging system for the butlers, but she'd make sure our request for coffee service got through. A short while later, the Butler did arrive with coffee, and was very helpful with a few other requests. But we're not sure he'd have shown if not for the operator, because the next day we put in two calls, and after waiting for over an hour for any response, we just gave up and used other services. We also found, that for a hotel that paid such attention to detail in other areas, the door staff was not its strong suit. At great hotels, the doormen are part of the guest's first impression, with a greeting, an opened door, and an offer of help. The staff, at least on our visit, were often sort of just standing around, in one case watching us lug a heavy bag up the stairs before finally offering some help with the second. No one greeted us or opened a door on our several trips in and out, and we were just a little surprised at this minor lapse in an otherwise fantastic experience.The King Cole bar is cozy, classically New York, and historic-feeling. The Astor Court restaurant is beautiful and relaxed the food a little hit-and-miss. Likewise, the Private Dining options vary from delicious to just okay. Again, these are relatively minor complaints and smallish pieces of what was, overall, perhaps the best hotel experience we've had in the U.S. or Europe. Congratulations to everyone at the St. Regis for maintaining this fantastic and important heritage property.Dear twinlions, We are very pleased to learn that so many associates provided you with exceptional service during your recent visit to The St. Regis New York.Thank you for your time, and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"I stayed here with my wife to celebrate her 30th birthday. At check in, our room was not ready yet, but we were brought to the beautiful bar and given free drinks until our room was available. When our room was prepared, we took the elevator up to our floor. The butler was waiting at the elevator to greet us and directed us to our room and showed us around and how to use everything. Because we were celebrating a special occasion, we were treated to some special amenities in the form of champagne and chocolate covered strawberries. It was quite unexpected and a really great touch. The room was wonderfully appointed and a generous size - particularly for a New York City hotel. The furniture was beautiful - all classic pieces from different eras... really just very well done. Silk wall coverings and beautiful crown moldings. Marble bathroom with a tv in the mirror over the sink. Quiet and isolated from the noise on the street. In the morning, we ate breakfast at the hotel - my wife said her breakfast was the best thing she had ever had to eat. Mine was delicious as well. We then took the house car (bentley service, complimentary for all hotel guests within a certain radius of the hotel) out to Columbus Circle for some shopping. The hospitality at the hotel is second to none. Really an excellent place to stay, meeting all of my expectations and exceeding some as well. This is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed at to date (definitely top 3)Dear jamGolf3, On behalf of The St. Regis New York, we thank you for both reviewing the property and allowing us to be a part of your New York City adventures and your celebration!

New York,The St. Regis New York,"We arrived by chance at the St.Regis after the Waldorf failed to provide us with an updated room. The St. Regis was very beautifully appointed and the front desk staff was very accommodating as well. We needed a larger room as we were having guests joins us for dessert and drinks and although there was an additional charge 1,000 more for the room, it was just what we needed and really pretty. The room however, was with out a view, or rather with a view of other building walls, so in the morning it was a bit dreary and dark. If you book a room at the St. Regis, make sure to ask for a high floor or you will be in darkness, despite the wonderful dcor and amenities.Dear Dirwpgops, Thank you for taking the time to detail your recent stay with us. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed your larger room but are dissapointed that you were not pleased with the view.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"Attention to detail was incredible at one of New York City's finest hotels.Our suite was beautiful, and despite being worried about traffic noise, we were surprised to have had a very restful night. We used travel points to book our room, and were very impressed to have been upgraded to a better room - this is excellent service and excellent recognition that people who travel all the time rarely cash in their points, but when they do ... it leaves a lasting impression and a very much increased likelihood that we will return and also highly recommend.Well done!Dear SuenearBoston, Thank you so much for staying at The St. Regis New York during your recent visit to New York City.We are so grateful for your feedback, and we thank you for taking the time to review your experience on TripAdvisor.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"I stayed at Ritz-Carlton Hotel during my last visit.However, St. Regis is located right on the 5th avenue where I dropped by twice.Once for a afternoon tea at Astor Court, after a long busy day. Varieties of sandwiches and scones were nicely served, just like they do at Ritz, London, I skipped dinner on that evening.The next evening I dropped by to have light snack before evening play. The club sandwich was a simple menu but the most delicious I have had. The over all service is excellent.I would definitely stay at this hotel if it situated near the Central Park, like Ritz-Carlton.Dear spaniel12, On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for sharing the details of your recent visit to Astor Court on TripAdvisor.At The St. Regis New York, we pride ourselves on our personalized service, and we are so glad that you were able to experience this first hand.Please let us know when you will be returning to New York, as we would love to welcome you back as our guest.Sincerely,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Nice spacious rooms, good location . The only thing bad about it is that they don't have buffet breakfast and it takes lot of time to get a table and it becomes quite expensive too. 2 of the mornings, I was offered high chairs of bar for breakfast which is not ideal when you pay about 60 dollars for simple omlette, juice and black coffee. But overall very good.Dear neeraj821,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at The St. Regis New York, and thank you for your comments regarding breakfast. We will share your feedback with our team for review, and appreciate your thoughts. We hope to see you again soon.Kindly,Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"From the moment we checked in to our last minute there, the service was world class. The hotel itself is located around the corner from 5th avenue with all the great shopping your wife could possibly want. Our room was ornate and luxurious. What you would expect from a St. Regis. The butler service was top notch and at our beck and call for a cup of tea or whatever we needed. Our first night we had difficulty getting a taxi to our restaurant, so the hotel have is a free ride in their own Bentley. They will do that if the location is not too far. The concierge made our dinner reservations for us in advance. Near the end of our meal, the waiter came back to our table with the manager and said your concierge asked us to provide with our house specialty (desert), which the hotel paid for. This hotel is the standard for great customer service. This is officially our hotel for NY. What a wonderful 5 star experience!Dear Dan B,We were delighted to have you stay with us at The St. Regis New York and are thrilled to hear that you had an enjoyable experience.Thank you for your time and for recognizing our mission to provide the best service and pampering experience to each of our guests.

New York,The St. Regis New York,"In New York it is uncommon to return to any large chain hotel and be greeted by the same person at the reception desk and even rarer for that person to actually remember you. Easy when they see your name you say but when they ask a personal question that indicates they really do remember you, it is special. My other posts on t.a. are redundantly complimentary about the St. Regis hotels. The lovely receptionist here in NYC, Je, is one of those special people. We try to visit NYC as often as possible being only 2 hours away in Connecticut and there is no finer place to stay than the St. Regis. I would highly recommend that if you enjoy traveling in style and want to be treated exceptionally well, get a Starwood American Express card and indulge yourself in its many generous gifts. Starwood is to be commended for attracting and keeping outstanding personel such as Je at the NYC St. Regis .Dear WHVIP,On behalf of the entire team at The St. Regis New York, we thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay at our hotel. We are thrilled to hear how much you enjoy staying here, and we deeply appreciate your loyalty. We will share your kind words with Jie, and look forward to seeing you again soon.Warmest Regards, Daniela CataldoDirector of Rooms"
New York,The St. Regis New York,"Stayed here to catch NYC at Christmas and were excited to stay in a legendary hotel. We have stayed at the St. Regis in Mexico City, Singapore and others, and were expecting the same level of excellence. We truly wanted to love this hotel, but instead, left feeling grateful we used points, and not cash, for our stay. Sad to say, we would not return. The good and the bad - The Good - Rooms are beautifully appointed, location can't be beat and some of the staff were outstanding. The Bad - Attention to detail has been lost. Some examples - long lines to check in and out. Yes, we realize it was high season, but staffing should be commensurate with the expected flow of guests. Next, after the bellhop delivered our bags, we asked for a bucket of ice. It never arrived and we had to get it ourselves. Breakfast took even longer than the ice. Small, but telling, details. Left feeling like the St. Regis NYC relies on its reputation to pull in the crowds, its service certainly doesn't warrant a pricey stay. Dear NOIDK, Thank you so much for taking the time to detail your recent experience at The St. Regis New York. We are deeply sorry that we were not able to meet your expectations during your recent visit to our hotel, all of which attributed to your negative feedback.Please allow us the opportunity of discussing your comments further so that we can examine the issues which you have noted. Our management team may be reached at GeneralManagerNYStRegis.com, and we would then be able to arrange a time at your convenience to speak.Sincerely, Octavia MargineanHotel Manager"

Los Angeles,Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,"Bad: I understand it is a japanese hotel but the American breakfast was terrible. I appreciate that they had all options, but the eggs weren't well cooked, the bacon wasn't cooked and for that it was expensive. there is no room service and for the hour i had to be at my conference it was hard to get out extra early to find a diner nearby. some didn't open in time. It was a buffet so super fast... I also don't eat alot of the other things they offered like the toast etc... and they had a full spread of what i assume would appeal to foreign visitors which i think is also great and nice for them. Good: it was very conveniently located to my conference across the street... Not the most luxurious hotel but certainly perfectly fine for me to attend conference across the street. The double tree down the road much more beautiful, but also much for expensive... I would stay here again as long as i could find a decent breakfast nearby. Staff very pleasant."
Los Angeles,Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,"Good: The best beds and pillows I have ever slept on. Near Little Tokyo, convenient."
Los Angeles,Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,"Bad: Furniture looks old but mantained very well. It will be perfect if there is a pool upstairs. Good: The foods near Little Tokyo,even more Japanese than Tokyo city itself. The best location."
Los Angeles,Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,Bad: Parking was very pricey. No discount for staying at the hotel. Walking too far away at night is very uncomfortable but during day it is great fun.. Good: Bed was high -had to climb up- but very comfortable with great fluffy pillows and linens! Japanese toilet seats! Able to adjust room climate. Convenient to Japanese stores and museum.

Los Angeles,Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,Bad: Room was really expensive for what it was Location was bad - takes up to 45 mins to get into Hollywood. Good: Bed was comfortable Place was clean
Los Angeles,Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,"Bad: Room walls are incredibly thin! Ambient noise from all around! I heard my neighbor sneeze, and I felt horrible coughing at night for fear of disturbing other floors! Parking and walking to the room was long and difficult with many bags. Limited hotel parking with expensive rates. Public parking becomes the only option, and while not as terribly inconvenient as you would think, it would still be nice if Miyako had their own, larger facilities. Good: Amazing location, and very cool bidet feature in the bathrooms. Spacious size rooms in the executive suites for the price value. AC kicks on very fast and cools the room nicely. Great views from floors higher up."
Los Angeles,Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,Good: THE HOTEL NEEDS A BETTER COFFEE SHOP FOR QUICK BREAKFAST. WHAT EXISTS THERE IS ONLY OKAY...IT IS NOT INVITING OR OFFERS MUCH WARMTH.
Los Angeles,Miyako Hotel Los Angeles,Good: Very comfortable bed and a super location to downtown Los Angeles.
Chicago,AC Hotel Chicago Downtown,"Bad: Wish there was a hot tub after walking around town all day. The breakfast was a too expensive. Good: Great location! Room was nice and clean, very modern. There was 6 of us and we got the two double beds and pull out couch. We all slept comfortably."

Chicago,AC Hotel Chicago Downtown,"Bad: Me and my husband came to Chicago for our 10 year wedding aniversary. My 10 year anyversary gift from my husband,a watch, was STOLEN from our room while it was being cleaned the day before we left Chicago.The head housekeeper claimd she talked to the person that cleaned our room,but said they didnt see any watch and told me I must have misplaced it, putting the robery on me!!We turned the room up side down,but of course there was NO WATCH!!Nobody offered to call the police,but we were told we could GO TO THE police station and file the paperwork.For two tourists in a country they have never been to before just a few days after the shooting that killed captain Paul Bauer, we didnt even know how to begin to talk to the police.We didnt get any compensation,but the head housekeeper offered us a drink at the bar..... finding out when we came back home that we were charged for the drink. Good: The front desk people were very helpful and nice - especially Emily Mendoza."
Chicago,AC Hotel Chicago Downtown,Good: The AC hotel was perfect for what we needed. We were a group of friends coming from different states to meet up. It was conveniently located close to public transportation and made it easy for all of us to get there. The hotel was in a great location! It's close to Michigan Avenue/ Water Tower Mall and Navy Pier.
Chicago,AC Hotel Chicago Downtown,"Bad: Breakfast was not included and in my opinion too expensive, especially for guests of your hotel. They told us it was a buffet and 15 per person. We didn't even check it out at that point. Good: Location was within walking distance of the Magnificent Mile. Price was reasonable for the location."

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast consisted of too much carbs (i.e. mainly bread, pastries and cakes), with no non-dairy options.

The staff were friendly and always willing to help."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: The wifi wasn't working for 3 days. .
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: Some of the front desk staff came off a bit rude. This is a nicer hotel, and we just felt like since we don't always dress fancy - after all, we were on vacation and out and about all day, every day - that we were looked down upon. We aren't fancy people but wanted to spoil ourselves for our anniversary. Good: We loved the location and the style of the hotel and the rooms. Caesar at the door was extremely welcoming and helpful."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: No AC in the elevator or hallway was a particularly cheap choice to save , Dana. Good: Apogee rooftop bar- fabulous, but why not open during the week Not cool."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: The elevators were a problem.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Need more than 2 small drawers The pillows given were too hard but when replaced w down - perfect!.

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: The bed/mattress was not as firm as I like. Good: The hotel staff was incredibly attentive and sent us a bottle or Prosseco and chocolate covered strawberries to help celebrate our anniversary. It was such a welcome surprise that really made our stay special. We also appreciated the drink tokens and lounge area with appetizers- made it very comfortable to stay there!
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: The street noise was pretty bad. Honking horns til all hours. Hard to sleep. Good: Loved the continental breakfast on every floor so you didn't have to go far. The staff was great and it was a great location.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Breakfast could of been better.. Good: Rooms an bed.. shower was awesome..
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bathroom is dated. Bath tub had rust build up. Room service failed to provide timely service and when the food arrived for 2 people, was only given silverware for 1. The evening reception provides 4 complimentary cocktails."

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: I liked that they offered a complimentary happy hour with appetizers and drinks.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: The website for hotel says happy hour food and a drink included. Nowhere on booking.com or Kinzie website does it mention that it's not included. So we were charged for it. I requested to have it removed and haven't heard back if they did so. But besides that, where the drinks/food is located is in a room with no windows/a dark cave. Not nice and not worth going to it. Sorry, nice thought but did not like. In this world of communication, it should be noted that there is a charge. Good: It was clean. Had good hair products. Bed and pillows were comfortable."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: Wine cooler too noisy. Good: Best staff and we have traveled the world. Kudos to front desk Jeff ....and Princes Kudos to TJ doorman LOVED our surprise suite Loved views and the luxury

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"I paid extra for a city view and what I got was a disappointing, ugly building right across the street. The extra money spent on having a city view was not worth it. It seemed clean. Nice room."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Good: I was always asked meaningful questions and was never hassled and never waited for a taxi. The service was great and quick and the room was beautiful plus I got exactly what I requested.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Good: Perfect Location, friendly staff, amazing rooms."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: I didn't appreciate the attitude of a few of the female employees in regards to the nightclub. I also would prefer a little more variety in the DJ's music choice. It seemed like ALL techno versions and sometimes we just want to hear the ACTUAL songs mixed. Other than that, I loved the property. Good: I loved the decor. Everything about the hotel from the lobby to the room was fantastic. The wood floors, the floor-to-ceiling windows, the shower overlooking the bedroom... PHENOMENAL! I loved the modern, but still comfortable feel. All employees I came in contact with had fantastic customer service skills with the exception of a few in the nightclub. Overall, this property is definitely on my list of Chicago properties as we visit often. Next time we will try out the spa as we didn't get a chance this visit."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: Shower. Good: Doorman was wonderful- very helpful.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: The breakfast was just some muffins and warm coffee. I guess there is no restaurant in the hotel. Good: The staff was great. The room was comfortable. The rates were very reasonable.
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Good: The shower was amazing, I cannot speak highly enough about the shower. I travel regularly and this was the best hotel that I have ever stayed at."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: That I couldn't stay longer. Good: The complimemtary continental breakfast on the rooftop was a very nice touch! Good coffee, too!"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: leave your car at home. parking cost is outrageous.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: The only thing I wish there could have been is hot food choices for breakfast, such as eggs and bacon or sausage. I did like how they set up the breakfast on each floor. That was very nice, however, having a place to eat outside of our room would be nice. But knowing there isn't anywhere to do that I think you do an excellent job with everything. We will definitely be coming back! Thank you. Good: The room and bathroom were spacious and very nice, very clean and updated. We stayed in the deluxe king room. Staff were all very nice and helpful!"
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: The check-in process was not good. I felt that I had been singled out as a young black male for staying at this hotel. Later, I also saw a young black male in the same situation as myself. In addition, every 45 minutes from 7:30 am - 11:45, I had housekeeping knock on the door twice, and two people walked in while my girlfriend and I were naked. Horrible experience. I called the next day to speak with the manager, left voice mails, and still no response!. Good: The majority of the staff was great."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Good: Wonderful, friendly staff and incredible location. Loved the happy hour and breakfast on each floor. Couldn't have done better for a first trip to Chicago."

This hotel deserves the high rates because of great staff, wonderful cosy room with a perfect bed, bathroom and tasty various breakfast.The location couldn't be better."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Good: The room we had was perfect: spacious, interesting urban views, lots of windows and light. Very good breakfast ... I liked everything in this hotel!!!!"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Floors need to be vacuumed much better. Finding old snack food and candy is not what I would expect. It wasn't horrible, but noticeable. On 2 separate occasions we had hotel staff come into our room. First time was shortly after we arrived. Housekeeping was confused on which room she was to clean. No big deal. 2nd time was on Monday morning, about 9:30-10AM, someone opened our door without knocking, noticed we were in there and left. By the time I could get up and get to the door, look out, they were gone. This was VERY odd and concerning. Good: Location was fantastic. Front desk staff were outstanding."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: Floor to ceiling see through glass in bathroom. Good: Large floor to ceiling windows overlooking downtown. Chic design.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Wish we were told about the 20 discount at the restaurant next door upon our arrival. Only saw the sign as we were checking out... Good: Friendly staff and great appetizers free from 5-8! Clean room and free wifi! Excellent!
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: Couldn't accept my prepaid credit card so had to pay cash, walking round with large sums of cash, even just across the road, didn't make me feel particularly safe. Good: Great restaurant downstairs, room clean and modern, shower was like standing under a waterfall."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bathrooms need renovating. Were not on par with rest of room. My shower/tub did not drain, at all, and water was up past my ankles by the time I finished showering. Every staff person I encountered was exceptionally helpful, polite, and friendly. Rooms were a nice size and had nice amenities."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: The breakfast was missing couple of important parts, this is not a big deal since Chicago is full of amazing breakfast restaurants. Good: It was clean, modern and had big rooms with free breakfast."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: service was prompt and friendly.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: breakfast in room!
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Best value in Chicago ! Super clean, comfortable, cosy hotel Staff is professional and super friendly. ....and you get complementary WiFi that WORKS.....super on the floor complementary breakfast PLUS a complimentary evening drink with snacks. What more can you ask for !!! Just love it"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: A bit expensive. Rooms do not have proper sunlight. Good: Very clean and comfortable. Breakfast was not good but it was free. Staff was very helpful. Location is great.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: No Lobby, you have to breakfast in your own room. Good: No restaurant, breakfast is misearable, The widows of Aluminium very cold and curtains are noisy"
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Good: Loved the modern look of the room.
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Good: ...Fantastic stay ! Staff was very helpful, I felt very safe there.... Thank You :)"

Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Good: I liked the uniqueness of the hotel, and especially the rooms. Great view out our balcony."

Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: no finger food during happy hour. Good: Great Breakfast
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Everything was great Excellent lake cation
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Saturday night was very loud inside and outside of hotel until 3:00 am. Good: accommodations were convenient and fine for stay in downtown
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Nothing to dislike at all!. Good: As a first time visitor to Chicago, the hotel was an excellent central location from which to explore. Firstly, the property, services, cleanliness, wifi and staff were very good. As mentioned by other users, there is a continental buffet served on a credenza on each floor outside the elevators from around 6.30 am. Some may want a more sumptuous offering, but this is a very generous continental breakfast and would be more than sufficient for most. Travelling to the hotel from O'Hare was simple. If you can read and follow English signs, it's an easy and cheap transition on the Blue Line public train into town. The hotel website gives precise information on which stop to disembark and the 5-10 minute walk to the property. Probably a better option to use taxis, Uber etc if you are travelling with lots of luggage or you have mobility issues. As for food and entertainment, the hotel is surrounded by excellent options. Restaurants and bars of all types abound. The House of Blues is right across the road for example. River Walk is also a highlight and is only a 3 minute walk away. The hotel area is well serviced by public transport and taxis, plus the first stop of Hop On/Hop Off Bus tour company is 5 minutes away in front of the Trump Building. As in other cities and countries that offer this service, it's an excellent way to get a quick feel for a new place, and Chicago is a stunning place to visit. By the way, Buddy Guy's Legends Bar is well worth a visit. People will always have various expectations, but I found the staff, service, amenities, and most of all the music on the night, to be fabulous as a musician and huge blues fan, this was a big tick on my personal bucket list. The H.O.B was also great, but didn't have time to get down to Rosa's Bar or Kingston Mines. I'll leave that for the next time............................but will be staying at the Kinzie."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Great location and can't beat the happy hour on the 6th floor
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: What I didnt like is the service of the staff. I reserved and paid last October a city view room, check in online on our way to the hotel and was assured key is waiting. But when we got there, no room available for city view. We were settled for a night in 3rd floor and we were assured the next 5nights we will be in the 6th floor. But the following day, they gave us a floor higher only, 4th floor. We cant see much of the city from 4th floor. All we can see is adjacent buildings. We were frustrated that there is no cafeteria for breakfast. Yeah, breakfast is included on the price but no chair to sit on, no table use. It is a grab and go breakfast. Very incovenient because breakfast is served in 5th and 6th floors's console table only. No microwave, no toaster. How can you eat the bagels they served in very cold temperature Secondly, we were not given instructions / info on our check in at the hotel what are the facilities they have for us. We only discovered while we were staying at the hotel. Like business center, fitness center,etc. The housekeeping, bad service! They forgot to replace the complimentary k-cup coffee. One day, they left a used pair of socks in our room. A pair of black socks rolled,dirty for a man whose size could be for a 6 footer and taller. My boys are only 5'3. Next day, they left again a wet soiled pink shirt on the table where the TV is. Why is that Everyday I always left as tip and a way of thank you for cleaning the room but all they leave is mess. Good: I like the location of this hotel. Very accessible to everything,from all kinds of food/resto to tourist attractions."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: Friendlier folks at the front desk...they are the first staff one interacts with at your hotel. They need to make eye contact and smile more. Interact with guests...make you feel welcome. Good: Housekeeping was awesome !!!
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: A little noisy but to be expected in the heart of downtown!. Good: Location. Friendly comfortable.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Nothing Great bed and shower. All you need. Great help yourself continental breakfast and liked the drink and snacks in the evening. Fabtastic location
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: Really don't have much to say about it. Good: Service was great.Room had nice view,wonderful roof top.We had spa services and they were great"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: It took a bit of time to get checked in. Good: Very clean, nice location, very modern facilities"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Good: Great location, clean and friendly staff."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Lovely helpful staff
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: it was all good. Good: lovely rooms, helpful staff, fast wifi, and nice gym"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"The reception desk guy at checkin was reckless. The breakfast is extremely poor (some apples, cakes and coffee) uncomfortably served in every corridor of each floor of the hotel. Comfort is absent, there is no soundproofing in the rooms facing the street, nor in the back. The use of ear plugs is mandatory and probably insufficient to reduce continuous noise (day and night) from heavy duty air conditioning equipment of many commercial buildings surrounding the hotel. The Hotel offers extremely poor value for money. It is not a four (4) stars at all. Staying there was hard and exhausting. AVOID IT. Suitable cleanliness and location."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Used my debit card to pay for room.. Normally charges are taken out day you leave but they took them out day I arrived then charged 76 extra just incase I broke or damaged something-they said I would get it back but it was still pended out of my account. Good: Loved the free breakfast
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: The Additional Charge for stay coverage which was a whopping 300 which was not mentioned at all from the Hotel until I arrived there.... . Good: The Location was great
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Good: Great location. Clean room, friendly staff. Would definitely stay there again."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Heating Systems make noise. Breakfast was OKish. Good: Well placed for visiting downtown museums etc.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Charge more than booking. Good: Locations
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: The water wasn't super hot the first day (maybe it was time of day) and there was no way to adjust the temperature of the room. Good: The staff were super friendly and helpful. The rooms were quaint but classy. Loved the balcony. The in-room wine selection was pretty neat. I'll definitely come back to experience more of what they have to offer.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Great value! Very friendly staff. Excellent location
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: The breakfast was not good. I kind of like the concept of serving breakfast in every floor, but I wish it could be more options for us that dont want to start every day with sweetened cereals and dough-nuts. But lots of places nearby that serves breakfast. Good: Location. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Best hotel robe Ive ever had. Beautiful room. Very nice staff.
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Good: Everything was amazing I will for sure be back!
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Phone in the room didn't work, and the valet was very slow. Good: Great location close to lots of places! Friendly staff!"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Nothing..great staff.. Good: Great hotel beds...
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Choice firmer pillows!. Good: Location +++ Unfussed arrangement of hotel facilities Value for money Helpful staff
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: everithing beyond our expectations.
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Good: The bar on the rooftop
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Expensive. Good: Great location. Very clean. Rooms are nicely appointed. Large bathroom. Responsive and friendly staff. Perfect continental breakfast.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"The breakfast was not good. I kind of like the concept of serving breakfast in every floor, but I wish it could be more options for us that dont want to start every day with sweetened cereals and dough-nuts. But lots of places nearby that serves breakfast. Location. Walking distance to everything we wanted to see."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast - pastries a little chewy. Good: Comfy beds, great location."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: Worst bartender ever. Long Island Iced Tea missing a few ingredients, King Alphonse was actually a Kahlua and cream with ice. Ugh. In-room coffee machine didn't work, took two days to get fixed, and then made awful coffee. Morning coffee from the restaurant was undrinkable. Thankfully, Starbucks nearby. Good: Best restaurant for dinner of any hotel anywhere. Entrees superb, bread pudding beyond superb. Excellent security staff -- Cheerfully and efficiently retrieved my forgotten keyboard, assured me it was safe, and FedExed it to me no charge. Decor stylish, cozy room made clever use of small space, room clean, rain shower nice. Non-convention type hotel very appealing. Really great value in accessible walkable location."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: no breakfast facilities and some incompetent staff. Good: nice location and simple business hotel type
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: The breakfast could have had more protein options. Good: Loved the room and the location
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Plates outside of hotel room door when we arrived stayed there all day and evening. Good: Bed extra comfy. Very courteous staff.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Wonderful hotel with great location and customer service. The lounge was amazing every night for a drink and snacks. Couldnt have asked for a better experience. Breakfast every morning was way better then we expected. Contacting the front desk was easy via text for anything we needed or with questions. We have traveled to many other cities and Europe and this was one of our top stays.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: I couldn't understand why the fan constantly as if it never reached the desired temperature.Also that nightly service fee of 14.95 is a rip-off.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Listed Parking but thought is was included... you should point that out. Good: Clean, modern, staff was outstanding"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Location
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Relatively small lobby. Good: Convenient to Mag. Mile, Loop, Millennium Park and restaurants. Also like continental breakfast brought up to the floor where you are staying."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Everyone was so nice. Thank you
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: everything was great besides the bar lounge on the top floor. It could use some renovations. Good: Bed was extremely comfortable!
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"The view Staff was Amazing, location was Great, the breakfast was incredible and the Happy Hour a was so nice and fun!!"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Overall I was very disappointed. I rarely write reviews, but I think everyone should keep in mind the following aspects of their trip and take the following all with a grain of salt. For the cost: Paid over 450/night for lowest price 1person room - highly overpriced, and overrated reviews I have to say. I was attending last minute trip for work, but wish I had chosen the Monaco, Drake, Intercontinental...Hyatt, Sheraton...anywhere else. For someone traveling on business, I would equate it to maybe a Hilton Doubletree, for four times the cost. Freebies: I didn't have the time given my work commitments to attend the free breakfast/snacks in evening, as I had to be out at other events, which already provided this. I didn't need the free internet as I had my own. Room Itself: This was probably the worst aspect, yet the most important, and what prompted my very negative rating. I overlooked a rusty building roof - wish I had taken a picture as I don't need gorgeous, but this was anything but. It really looked like if I opened the window I would get some form of lung disease. I would have closed the blinds...but they were blackout blinds...which you don't want if waking up at 5-6 for work events. The room was lackluster, and though there are only 6 floors, there are 2 VERY slow elevators, one of which was not working for a good portion of my stay, so don't try to get anywhere on time, or plan to be late and blame it on the elevators with a legit excuse. Overall: I expected more when I saw the cost, positive ratings, the reviews for boutique - this was anything but. Disappointing stay, especially when my work conference overlapped with my birthday. Will not be returning. Good: On the plus side, the people at the front desk were fine - the doormen were fine and one woman at front when you walk in was extremely nice and I have to give her probably the most positive review for being most pleasant. Other desk guy was fine but clearly apathetic and not going out of his way to be friendly. Appreciated ability to store luggage in between end of stay and flight departure...but again, not something that makes hotel stand out."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Staff extremely helpful and friendly. The breakfast in the morning on the rooftop lounge was a lovely bonus.

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,The breakfast could have been better by including some hot foods. The bed and pillows were very comfy. The rooms was nice and clean. The staff was very friendly.
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: Rooftop bar is more style than substance, go to be seen, not to enjoy view or surroundings, and inconvenient to have to go downstairs to go back up. Perhaps a residents hour for hotel guests only, when lift can go directly up. Good: Great location, very stylish, helpful staff especially the doormen"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Pounding noise at 3:00a,m, machinery of some type. Several in our party had turn down service and cookies-we did not. Good: Rooms were very clean. Check-in expedient."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Large rooms and comfotable The rooms are very comfortable, however the road outside is noisy so sleep patterns are interrupted Breakfast is on your landing so a bit like boarding school!"

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: The hotel has no real public areas, and there's a facilities fee which I didn't realize. The reception staff weren't that helpful.

Good: The bed was comfortable with a really good sized bathroom. WiFi was good."

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Crazy static electricity in the rooms during winter. Good: Awesome place, and service."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Used my credit card to hold reservation but was going to pay cash. When I checked out they said they already processed my credit card and would not refund it and l could not pay cash. I am from Canada and have a US bank account so when the Can and US dollars were at par I put my travel money into it. By paying with my credit card, I ended up paying an extra 150 in exchange rate and user fees. They also charged my credit card the day I booked- which I didn't know until my statement came in. Good: beds were very comfortable. breakfast in hallway every morning very convenient. location was good-very close to river and a couple of blocks from metro stations. Staff very friendly."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: None. Good: My overall experience was great!

Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Good: Have been there four or five times so I think that tells you all
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: Almost rude guy who checked me in. Good: Desk staff are meh, but bartenders, concierge and gorgeous door men are all great, Super helpful and friendly"
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: On one day breakfast was downstairs and was too small and tight a space for number of guests. Good: Beds comfortable, mini bar reasonably priced fab location"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"The bath tub was rusty..literally, mildew along the edge, and small. The bed was very hard and uncomfortable. The Free 14.95 breakfast was terrible, couldn't drink the coffee it was so bitter and nothing hot was offered. The room ended up being 100 more than advertised after all the taxes and what was supposed to be free breakfast... Location"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: There was no complimentary bottle of water. If you need water, you need to buy from the mini bar. For the breakfast, wish there were more hot food. Good: Liked the fact there was breakfast on every floor and enjoyed the drinks in the evening."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: I had someone partying and playing super loud music above me or next to me all night. Got no sleep.
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Bad: The music in the lobby was horrendous. House music that made me want to die or run away with my hands over my ears. Totally cruel to make the hotel receptionists listen to that all day long and it made the lobby an undesirable place to spend time. They should be playing jazz or something easy on the ears. Good: Location and room/decor, amenities"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Soft mattress on the bed. Good: Nice happy hour drink. Nice breakfast buffet. Large room in great location.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Good: Loved our room, bed, breakfast buffet, fridge in room, free WiFi , location, happy hour, and outstanding suggestions and great help from Concierge, Ken. Highly recommend this hotel."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: We had a really rude man greet us at the check in counter. When my dad didn't understand what he was asking he gave him such an attitude. Everything else was perfect except for that encounter.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: The convienance to everything. Just by walking out the front door of Kinzie Hotel.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Our room view was pretty poor as it was looking out and into adjacent old building and seeing right into others apartments. Had to totally close blinds for any privacy. That blocked all of the natural lighting. A suggestion or 2: !. Letting people know where their room is located within the facility so they could ask for a different view if it was available. 2. Having blinds that pull up from the bottom (instead of down from the top) would allow some privacy from close buildings and still allow some natural light into the rooms that have this issue). Additionally some kind of break on parking would be a great addition. Our parking costs almost as much as one nights stay!. Good: Social Hour was unexpected and fun. Made some new friends!
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: Not much of a view. Good: Great location. Small hotel with good service. Lots of pillows:)
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Breakfast! The hotel advertises a good breakfast while they only serve cold continental breakfast. Good: Location was convenient, staff were friendly, room was spacious and clean"

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: I wanted to watch Netflix and couldn't, BUT THEY SAID NETFLIX WAS COMING!! By the end of August the hotel is getting new TV system to watch my shows! So my one negative will be fixed!!. Good: The staff was amazingly friendly! Breakfast was on each guest room floor and got to have breakfast in bed!! Free food and drink in the lounge every night. It was so easy to get around the city. Most of it was within walking distance, but I took the L to Wrigley Field. Super Easy! Free Wifi as well."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Absolutely nothing!. Good: Such a relaxing hotel in the hub of the city. Breakfast located on each floor next to the lift was great, bed was sooo comfy, bathroom fab and the view stunning. Cocktail hour with nibbles each night was such a nice touch. What makes the Kinzie thou are the staff!"
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Best sleep I've had at a hotel
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Why didn't I know about Kinzie West That is what you show in your ads, but I got only the highest floor of the Unwest Kinzie. I was expecting a better view of the city."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: The view of the alley way buildings.
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,Bad: When two people sleep in the bed you settle to the middle of bed and makes for a uncomfortable night's rest. Good: The hotel location and the room layout and scenery was very nice.
Chicago,Moxy Chicago Downtown,"Stayed a few days while on business, big mistake. I don't want an experience from my Hotel - I want value for my money. No Closet, No dressers, No coffee maker, No Frig, No Microwave, No Bathtub, No Iron, No ice machines, No room service, No Workspace and of course no free breakfast. They give you a poker chip for one free coffee or drink. It is geared towards those who don't need any of these amenities and want to hang out in a noisy bar environment for your computer work. They give you a small tray table about 15x15 inches to work on in your room, that doesn't cut it for me. I get the revenue play with putting more rooms in a much small piece of real estate but for the nightly cost, a business traveler can find much nicer hotels in Chicago. I would suggest an improvement would be to have a fold up table on the wall and a chair at least. Traveler beware if your are on business (especially a women) this is most likely not the place for you - unless you just want tacos and the free lollypop from room service. I think the Do Not Disturb sign with the young guy in his under ware hugging a teddy bear says it all."
Chicago,dana hotel and spa,"Good: the location was perfect, the hotel spa was very good with variety of service, the staff were extra friendly the room was clean. would defiantly come again."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: View. We had a view of an alley. But, that's the only downside. Good: Staff was extremely helpful. Rooms were well-appointed, clean and functional."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: Ac did not work
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: No parking. Good: Location Room looks Additional appetizer
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bar wasn't open very long. Great location. Loved the spread at the bar at happy hour as well as drink tokens.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: The bed was very uncomfortable. Lumpy and too soft. Good: Central location. Easy check-in and out. Nice touches. Access to breakfast on each floor with a tray to use in your room-protein from hard boiled egg and yogurt, fresh baked goods, cereal (hot and cold). Fitness center had a variety of cardio equipment and weights."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: Parking was expensive at 62 for 1 night, and o thought it was included but it wasn't. Good: Location was near sightseeing."
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Good: All the staff was genuinely friendly.
Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,Bad: The complimentary breakfast was not good at all. Kinda a joke. Very disappointing. For the money we spent for the room we expected a bit more. Good: Staff was nice and helpful. Room was clean and somewhat nice.

Chicago,Kinzie Hotel,"Bad: The breakfast was just ok :/. Good: Loved the bed and bathroom :) Also, the service was exceptional!!"
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,Bad: Dropped in for advice on a good Japanese restaurant. The concierge seemed perplexed and said he would call or email with info. He never did. In fact there was a great sushi just in front of the hotel. Very strange. When I called the concierge from outside the hotel I was put on hold and left on hold. I could have died on hold. The rooms need a facelift and I have stayed in better for half the price. The restaurant for breakfast is soulless and very expensive and not up to much. Regarding the above you have many comments on TripAdvisor about the same so why not do something about it. Good: Joyce the concierge ( I think that was her name) made up for the others who probably couldn't find Los Angeles on the map. The pool. The location That's it.
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,Bad: They don't even offer you some water or a complementary drink or fruit. Comparing to the charges.
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,Good: Location and comfort
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,"Bad: The prices of the SPA treatment are quite expensive. If you go to most expensive SPA in Dubai the treatment can varies between USD 120 for normal facial cleansing up to USD 500 or 600 for a full package of 4 hours . Yet here the minimum starts at USD 280/- excluding the taxes ! . Good: What not to like about this property !!! Everything was great. The location, the spacious rooms the view the room service the in room dining the restaurants even the Spa. Ok I didn't try the spa due to my busy schedule but it looked so good (although the prices of the treatments were quite expensive). Some people thing that the hotel is a bit expensive, well it is located in one of the most prestigious and expensive districts in LA. It is just located on the famous Rodeo Drive. The rooms were big. I advise you to not take the room with balconies if you know your self won't use it. The balcony takes space out of the room. My most concerns and worries normally in any hotel is the cleanness of the bathroom and toilets and here it was just perfect."
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,"Bad: Insufficient service at the reception, had to wait at check in and out, only 1 or 2 staff. Good: Helpful staff, excellent service, comfort, location, luxury."
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,Bad: Missed check in by almost 2 hrs. Good: Location decor bar service
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,Good: Location.
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,"Bad: Even tough considered an exlusive hotel it is quite expensive for what you get and the hotel parking is way too expensive. The TV location in the room is a bit forced and not so comfortable from all angles. Good: Fantastic location, great personal attention from the staff. Very clean."
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,Bad: Dirty windows in the room dirty carpet in hallway and dirty door for service entrance 3 rd floor. Good: The gentleman at reception and the valets
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,"Bad: The Parq Bar menu is extremely poor. The hotel charges 6 delivery fees for room service! There is no open buffet option for breakfast. The breakfast area is understaffed, and the 1 or 2 waiters/waitresses there are slow and inefficient. Good: The location of the hotel is amazing. The Parq Bar atmosphere at night is very nice. The concierge service in the hotel is very efficient."
Beverly Hills,Montage Beverly Hills,Bad: I dont like the anchovies in the Caesar dressing. Good: Bed and pillows are the best
San Francisco,Hotel Zetta San Francisco,Good: Perfect hotel
